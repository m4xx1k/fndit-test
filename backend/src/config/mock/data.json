						"__cdata": "<p>Foldables and watches weren't all that Samsung announced at today's Unpacked event&mdash;the company also unveiled its newest earbuds, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro and Galaxy Buds 3. </p><h2>Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</h2><p>The first thing you'll notice about the new Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is how similar they look to Apple's AirPods Pro, with a new stem design and silicone ear tips. Each earbud has touch controls along with LEDs to show you the battery life, which you'll be able to see from the transparent cover on the charging case. </p><p>For sound, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have an enhanced 2-way dual amp and dynamic driver along with Adaptive ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) and EQ. </p><p>One cool feature for the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is Auto Noise Adjustment, which can automatically adjust the ANC for you. For example, if your earbuds detect an ambulance siren, they'll turn the ANC to Ambient mode so you can stay aware of what's going on around you. If there's construction noise, they'll turn up the ANC to full to block any external noise.</p><p>Music playback time on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is up to 6 hours with ANC on and 7 hours with ANC off. You'll also get an additional 30 hours from the charging case. The actual battery capacity for each earbud is 50 mAh by itself and 500 mAh in the case. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro comes in two colors, Silver and White. The earbuds are also IP57 water and dust-resistant. </p><p>You can pre-order the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro for $249 today, and they ship on July 24th.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2A7ZG92W6JP8KAEA0D3P9H0/images-1.fill.size_2000x1506.v1720561027.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 series\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1506\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2A7ZG92W6JP8KAEA0D3P9H0/images-1.fill.size_800x602.v1720561027.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2A7ZG92W6JP8KAEA0D3P9H0/images-1.fill.size_1400x1054.v1720561027.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2A7ZG92W6JP8KAEA0D3P9H0/images-1.fill.size_2000x1506.v1720561027.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\"></span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Sachin Bahal</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<h2>Samsung Galaxy Buds 3</h2><p>For those who can't stand silicone ear tips, the Galaxy Buds 3 might be up your alley. The new Galaxy Buds 3 look a lot like the standard AirPods thanks to their new stem design. Just like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, the Buds 3 have touch controls, but there are no LEDs for showing battery life. </p><p>For sound, the Galaxy Buds 3 has a 1-way single amp and dynamic driver along with Adaptive ANC (an odd choice for buds without a seal). With the standard Buds 3, you lose out on the Auto Noise Adjustment feature that the Buds 3 Pro have. The Buds 3 are also IP57 water and dust-resistant. </p><p>Music playtime on the Buds 3 is up to 5 hours with ANC on and 6 hours with ANC off. You'll get an additional 24 to 30 hours from the charging case, depending on if you have ANC on or off. The Galaxy Buds 3 will be available in Silver and White colors. </p><p>Pre-orders for the Galaxy Buds 3 begin today ay $179, and they ship on July 24th.</p>"

						"__cdata": "<p>At its latest Unpacked event, Samsung showed off the Galaxy Watch 7 and the new Galaxy Watch Ultra. Both watches offer some exciting upgrades for those in the market for a new Samsung smartwatch, but the latter is also a serious shot at Apple's premium smartwatch crown. </p><h2>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</h2><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra is a brand new model aimed at those looking for a more rugged smartwatch that can go toe-to-toe with the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-watch-ultra-2-vs-apple-watch-se\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Watch Ultra</a>. The Watch Ultra only comes in one size, 47mm, and has a 1.47-inch Super AMOLED display (meaning it's slightly brighter and more vivid than past Samsung AMOLED displays). </p><p>The watch uses Grade 4 Titanium materials and is IP68 water and dust-resistant. It can also be used at high altitudes (up to 9,000 meters) and can withstand up to 10ATM of pressure. For those planning on using the Watch UItra while hiking, the watch has a built-in siren in case of emergencies, and there will be an LTE variant of the watch available. </p><p>Powering the watch is the Samsung Exynos W1000 chip, which should make navigating Wear OS much smoother. There's also 32GB of internal storage and 2GB of RAM. The battery in the Galaxy Watch Ultra is 590 mAh with Fast Charging support, so the watch should easily last days. Sensors are on par with the current  Watch 6 lineup. The Galaxy Watch Ultra will be available in Titanium Grey, White and Silver color options. Sadly, it doesn't have a rotating bezel, so you'll have to resort to a touch bezel instead.</p><p>You can <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/V06m1?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=News&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=pre-order%20the%20Galaxy%20Watch%20Ultra&amp;short_url=V06m1&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">pre-order the Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> starting for $649 today and it'll launch on July 24th.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</h2><p>If you don't need such a big and rugged watch, there's the Galaxy Watch 7. The watch comes in two sizes: 40mm with a 1.31-inch screen and 44mm with a 1.47-inch screen. It also lacks the rotating bezel, but there is a touch bezel to control your watch without using the touchscreen. </p><p>The Galaxy Watch 7 is powered by the Exynos W1000 chip with 2GB of RAM along with 32GB of storage. The battery in the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 is 300 mAh, while the 44mm has a 425 mAh battery, but both have Fast Charging support. The Watch 7 is also IP68 water and dust-resistant and is made from aluminum materials. Like the Ultra, sensors are on par with both Galaxy Watch 6 options, so you won't lose any readings by choosing the 7 over the Ultra. Color choices for the Galaxy Watch 7 include Cream, Silver and Green</p><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/EyWqM?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=News&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Pre-orders%20for%20the%20Galaxy%20Watch%207&amp;short_url=EyWqM&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Pre-orders for the Galaxy Watch 7</a> start today for $299 and ship on July 24th.</p>"

						"__cdata": "<p>While it's slightly earlier than the usual August time slot, Samsung has unfolded all the details about its latest folding phones, officially announcing the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6. While they might look similar to last year's models, there are some differences for both options. </p><h2>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</h2><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2A56AGC8KFRNYZ6JE6J8T4B/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720560950.png\" alt=\"Galaxy Z Fold 6\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2A56AGC8KFRNYZ6JE6J8T4B/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1720560950.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2A56AGC8KFRNYZ6JE6J8T4B/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1720560950.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2A56AGC8KFRNYZ6JE6J8T4B/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720560950.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\"></span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Sachin Bahal</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Starting with the Galaxy Z Fold 6, the phone shares a familiar design with last year's Z Fold 5, including its fold-flat hinge design. But when you pick up the Fold 6, the first thing users will notice is how much lighter it is, thanks to the new aluminum frame. The phone is 239g compared to 256g for the Fold 5. </p><p>Another key difference is that the Fold 6 now has IP48 water and dust resistance, compared to IPX8 on previous Fold models. The 4 signifies it is slightly effective against dust and the 8 means it can withstand 3 feet of water. </p><p>The folding AMOLED screen on the Z Fold 6 is still 7.6 inches large, but Samsung has shrunken the bezels around the screen to make them less noticeable. New for this year is the slightly larger 6.3-inch Cover Display (also AMOLED), which should make it easier to use the phone without needing the larger main display.</p><p>Powering the Z Fold 6 is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chip along with 12GB of RAM, which should be enough power for video editing and demanding games. Storage options include 256GB, 512GB and 1TB. The battery in the Fold 6 is still 4,400 mAh with 25W Super Fast Wired charging and 15W wireless charging.</p><p>For cameras, the Fold 6 has a 50MP primary wide lens, 12MP Ultra Wide and 10MP telephoto, which is identical to the Fold 5. There's also a 4MP under-display camera and a 10MP camera on the Cover Display. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 will be available in a few colors, including Navy, Pink, and Silver Shadow. </p><p>You can <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Ddo0W?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=News&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=pre-order%20the%20Galaxy%20Z%20Fold%206&amp;short_url=Ddo0W&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">pre-order the Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> today starting at $1,899, and it'll launch on July 24th.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</h2><p>For the Flip 6, there's not too many changes, so the phone is more a refinement from the Flip 5. The AMOLED main folding screen is 6.7 inches and the Flex Window is 3.4 inches.</p><p>Powering the Flip 6 is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy processor with 12GB of RAM, so it's as powerful as the Fold 6. The battery in the Flip 6 is now 4,000 mAh compared to 3,700 mAh in the Flip 5, so you should expect better battery life this time around. Just like the Fold 6, the Flip 6 is IP48 water and dust-resistant, so no need to be super careful with your phone. </p><p>On the camera side, the Flip 6 gets a new 50MP wide-angle lens (compared to 12MP before) but the phone still retains the 12MP ultrawide lens. There's also a 10MP selfie camera. Storage options for the Flip 6 include 256GB and 512GB. Some color options for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 include Silver Shadow, Blue, Mint, and Yellow. </p><p><a href=\"https://zdcs.link/BdAJV?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=News&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Pre-orders%20for%20the%20Galaxy%20Z%20Flip%206&amp;short_url=BdAJV&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Pre-orders for the Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> start today at $1,099, and it'll launch on July 24th.</p>"

					"thumbnail": "",
					"encoded": {
						"__cdata": "<p>Plants are living things&mdash;and all living things will eventually stop living. The trick is knowing when your plant has either shuffled off this mortal coil or is going to, so you know to stop investing resources or risking nearby plants with something infectious. While a brown, withered plant in a dry planter is as close to DOA as the plant world can offer, it's not the only sign you should pull up roots and move on.&nbsp;</p><h2>Indoor plants</h2><p>If your plant has turned brown and crispy, it&rsquo;s likely time to call it a day. You can always try to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/drown-your-potted-plants-1850646521\" target=\"_blank\">drench</a> the plant to give the roots a chance, trim back the brown leaves and see if, in a few weeks, any new shoots are produced. The roots are really the factor here. If the roots are moldy, smelly or slimy, the plant has gone to the other side. If the roots are just brown and dry, your plant could be dormant. To tell, scratch a branch or root and see if underneath it is green and damp. If so, that plant is on winter vacay and can come back in spring with adequate water, light and food. Plants go dormant for all kinds of reasons, but it&rsquo;s usually environmental stress like cold weather or a lack of nutrients or water.&nbsp;</p><h2>Outdoor plants</h2><p>Since the weather is harder to control outside, you may lose plants, even large ones like shrubs, to extreme heat or cold. We experienced a freezing event this year that took out giant 20-year-old hydrangeas, artichokes and daphne, which I mourned. Heat domes can cause the same problems, and it&rsquo;s not always likely you&rsquo;ll see the results of these extreme weather events immediately. The plants may be dormant when the event happens, so you&rsquo;ll only know when it doesn&rsquo;t spring back to life in the warmer weather. If you&rsquo;re in the prime season for a shrub or bush and it is still just brown and unproductive, it is reasonable to perform a scratch test on the bark to see if it&rsquo;s still viable. If it is following a weather event, it&rsquo;s likely not. In those cases, while the plant is not hurting anything by staying put, you&rsquo;re missing the opportunity to replace it. Gardens are always changing. You can cut the shrub or bush at the ground, leaving the roots to decompose in the soil. Be sure to give the soil some food before you plant something new.&nbsp;</p><p>The other reason you&rsquo;ll lose plants outside is disease like viruses and funguses&mdash;this is more problematic because it can spread, and in many cases, remain in the soil, where it will infect new plants. There are thousands of viruses and funguses in the plant world, some specific to a type of plant like peach leaf curl, and some which can affect a lot of different types like mosaic virus. Generally, the signs you need to look for are brown or black spots, brown or black ends on leaves or yellowing of leaves. Once that happens, you should immediately cut that vegetation away, using shears that have been sprayed with bleach solution or vinegar to clean them, and ensure you do not touch other plants with the clippings. Put them in a plastic bag and get thee to a nursery to ask what the problem is. Once diagnosed, you&rsquo;ll know if it&rsquo;s solvable with a fungicide or other treatment, or if these plants need to get pulled and go in the trash (not compost!). Again, this process should be done quickly&mdash;you will be less traumatized losing one tomato plant than all your tomato plants.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll also want to ask about how long to leave the soil or how to treat it so that it's safe to plant in next season.&nbsp;</p><p>By the way: For many nurseries, you can actually return a dead plant. I&rsquo;ll admit, I have always found this practice somewhat mortifying, but now that I know nursery owners and workers, I have a different perspective. They encourage the practice because they&rsquo;re invested in your garden for a lifetime, and it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll buy something else when you return the expired plant.</p><h2>Trees</h2><p>Trees are fantastic for shade, fruit, and natural habitat. They are not so good for staying up in storms, getting all the water they need, and being impervious to pests. Trees are expensive and can be dangerous when one is dying or dead&mdash;dead trees cause massive damage to structures and are a real threat to people, too.&nbsp;Unfortunately, treating or removing trees is also expensive, and could require permits.&nbsp;</p><p>First, examine the trunk of the tree. Look for splitting, cracks or peeling bark. These are warning signs. Are there mushrooms growing near the trees roots or trunk? That's a sign of decay. Finally, are you seeing many branches without any active buds during spring? You may have a dead tree, and that means you need to get a qualified tree trimming company to check on the health of your tree.&nbsp;</p>"

A new puzzle goes live every day at midnight, your local time.</p><p>Start by guessing a five-letter word. The letters of the word will turn green if they&rsquo;re correct, yellow if you have the right letter in the wrong place, or gray if the letter isn&rsquo;t in the day&rsquo;s secret word at all.

Let&rsquo;s go!</p><hr><h2>Does today&rsquo;s Wordle have any unusual letters?</h2><p>We&rsquo;ll define common letters as those that appear in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etaoin_shrdlu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>old typesetters&rsquo; phrase</u></a> ETAOIN SHRDLU.

The hint was &ldquo;like the sound of a trumpet or siren&rdquo; and the answer contained four common letters and one fairly common letters. </p><p>The answer to yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle was BLARE. </p><h2>A primer on Wordle basics</h2><p>The idea of Wordle is to guess the day&rsquo;s secret word. When you first open the Wordle game, you&rsquo;ll see an empty grid of letters. It&rsquo;s up to <em>you</em> to make the first move: type in any five-letter word.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, you can use the colors that are revealed to get clues about the word:&nbsp;<strong>Green</strong> means you correctly guessed a letter, and it&rsquo;s in the correct position. (For example, if you guess PARTY, and the word is actually PURSE, the P and R will be green.)</p><ul><li><p><strong>Yellow</strong> means the letter is somewhere in the word, but not in the position you guessed it. (For example, if you guessed PARTY, but the word is actually ROAST, the R, A and T will all be yellow.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Gray</strong> means the letter is not in the solution word at all. (If you guessed PARTY and everything is gray, then the solution <em>cannot</em> be PURSE or ROAST.)</p></li></ul><p>With all that in mind, guess another word, and then another, trying to land on the correct word before you run out of chances. You get six guesses, and then it&rsquo;s game over.</p><h2>The best starter words for Wordle</h2><p>What should you play for that first guess? The best starters tend to contain common letters, to increase the chances of getting yellow and green squares to guide your guessing. (And if you get all grays when guessing common letters, that&rsquo;s <em>still</em> excellent information to help you rule out possibilities.) There isn&rsquo;t a single &ldquo;best&rdquo; starting word, but the New York Times&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/this-bot-can-tell-you-how-good-you-really-are-at-wordle-1848769075\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Wordle analysis bot</u></a> has suggested starting with one of these:</p><ul><li><p>CRANE</p></li><li><p>TRACE</p></li><li><p>SLANT</p></li><li><p>CRATE</p></li><li><p>CARTE</p></li></ul><p>Meanwhile, an MIT analysis <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/science-thinks-it-has-found-the-best-wordle-starter-1849541276\" target=\"_blank\"><u>found</u></a> that you&rsquo;ll eliminate the most possibilities in the first round by starting with one of these:</p><ul><li><p>SALET</p></li><li><p>REAST</p></li><li><p>TRACE</p></li><li><p>CRATE</p></li><li><p>SLATE</p></li></ul><p>Other good picks might be ARISE or ROUND. Words like ADIEU and AUDIO get more vowels in play, but you could argue that it&rsquo;s better to start with an emphasis on consonants, using a starter like RENTS or CLAMP. Choose your strategy, and see how it plays out.</p><h2>How to win at Wordle</h2><p>We have a few guides to Wordle strategy, which you might like to read over if you&rsquo;re a serious student of the game. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-win-at-wordle-according-to-my-wife-1848480285\" target=\"_blank\"><u>This one</u></a> covers how to use consonants to your advantage, while <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-master-or-cheat-at-wordle-the-internets-favor-1848312354\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this one</u></a> focuses on a strategy that uses the most common letters. In <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-try-quordle-if-youre-too-good-at-wordle-1848540319\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this advanced guide</u></a>, we detail a three-pronged approach for fishing for hints while maximizing your chances of winning quickly.</p><p>The biggest thing that separates Wordle winners from Wordle losers is that winners <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-lost-wordle-today-1850348061\" target=\"_blank\"><u>use their guesses to gather information about what letters are in the word</u></a>. If you know that the word must end in -OUND, don&rsquo;t waste four guesses on MOUND, ROUND, SOUND, and HOUND; combine those consonants and guess MARSH. If the H lights up in yellow, you know the solution.</p><p>One more note on strategy: the original Wordle used a list of about 2,300 solution words, but after the game was bought by the NYT, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/wordle-has-themes-now-so-you-should-change-your-strate-1849840529\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the game now has an editor who hand-picks the solutions</u></a>. Sometimes they are slightly tricky words that wouldn&rsquo;t have made the original list, and sometimes they are topical. For example, FEAST was the solution one Thanksgiving. So keep in mind that there may be a theme.</p><h2>Wordle alternatives</h2><p>If you can&rsquo;t get enough of five-letter guessing games and their kin, the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-10-best-wordle-alternatives-ranked-by-difficulty-1848859009\" target=\"_blank\"><u>best Wordle alternatives</u></a>, ranked by difficulty, include:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://wheelsrpgs.itch.io/wheeldle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Wheeldle, which lets you play one puzzle after another</u></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://zaratustra.itch.io/dordle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Dordle</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/games/quordle/#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Quordle</u></a>, which ask you to play two (Dordle) or four (Quordle) puzzles at the same time, with the same guesses.

						"__cdata": "<p>Proton has officially launched <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/proton-just-launched-a-more-private-version-of-google-docs\" target=\"_blank\">Docs in Proton Drive</a>, a new web-based productivity app that gives you access to a fully-featured text editor with shared editing capabilities and full end-to-end encryption. It's meant to take on Google Docs&mdash;one of the leading online word processors in the world, and make it more convenient to use <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-choose-between-proton-drive-and-google-drive-for-cloud-storage\" target=\"_blank\">Proton's storage service</a>. But how exactly does Proton&rsquo;s document editor compare to Google&rsquo;s? Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p><h2>Docs in Proton Drive has a familiar face</h2><p>On the surface, Docs in Proton Drive&mdash;or Proton Docs as some folks have begun calling it for simplicity&rsquo;s sake&mdash;looks just like Google Docs. And that&rsquo;s to be expected. Text editors don't have much reason to stray from the same basic \"white page with a bunch of toolbars\" look, and they all offer the same types of tools like headlines, bullet points, font changes, highlighting, etc.</p><p>Much like Google Docs, Proton&rsquo;s document editor gives you a nice, big playing field for your words. It&rsquo;s also easy to configure the sharing features&mdash;just like in Google Docs&mdash;by interacting with the Share menu up in the interface's top right-hand corner. In fact, it looks like Proton has gone out of its way to ensure that everything about Docs in Proton Drive is familiar and easy to get used to if you&rsquo;re coming to it from Google&rsquo;s editor.</p><p>Swapping between services is barely an inconvenience&mdash;in addition to what I laid about above, you can also still add inline images, tables, and more. Pretty much everything is here. The biggest barrier is that, much like Google Docs requires users to have a Google account to access and edit documents, Docs in Proton Drive requires you to have a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/proton-unlimited-review-worth-it-vpn-password-manager-secure-email\" target=\"_blank\">free Proton account</a>. But there's little reason to use the service without one, plus a Proton account gives you access to Proton Drive and several of Proton&rsquo;s other free apps, too.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2CA3S52Y6AEQ7VKMYHVB54K/images-1.fill.size_2000x987.v1720557561.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Docs in Proton Drive\" width=\"2000\" height=\"987\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2CA3S52Y6AEQ7VKMYHVB54K/images-1.fill.size_800x395.v1720557561.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2CA3S52Y6AEQ7VKMYHVB54K/images-1.fill.size_1400x691.v1720557561.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2CA3S52Y6AEQ7VKMYHVB54K/images-1.fill.size_2000x987.v1720557561.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\"></span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<h2>The difference isn't in the app itself</h2><p>If the text editors themselves are so simple, why am I writing this article? Comparing basic text editors might seem a bit silly, true, but there&rsquo;s one big thing that really sets Proton apart from other text editors out there, especially Google Docs: end-to-end encryption.</p><p>Proton has built its entire business around the motto of &ldquo;privacy first,&rdquo; and that extends to the company&rsquo;s latest software offerings, too. Docs in Proton Drive includes complete end-to-end encryption&mdash;down to your cursor movements&mdash;which means nobody, not even Proton, can track what you&rsquo;re doing in your documents. They're locked down before they even reach Proton's servers.</p><p>This makes the product very enticing for businesses that might want to keep their work as private as possible while also still having the same functionality as Google Docs&mdash;because Proton isn&rsquo;t missing any of the functionality that Google Docs offers, aside from the way that Google Docs integrates with the rest of the Google Suite of products.</p><p>That's not to say that Google isn&rsquo;t secure. Google does utilize its own level of encryption when storing your data in the cloud. However, it isn&rsquo;t completely end-to-end encrypted, so Google has open access to your data. Google says it only <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">trains its generative AI on \"publicly accessible\" information</a>, and while that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-docs-publicly-available-ai-training-settings-private-shared-2024-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">probably won't affect most people</a>, it is a pain point for many, especially as the company does make exceptions for features like Smart Compose.</p><p>That worry is why products with end-to-end encryption have become such a commodity in recent years&mdash;especially as <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/security\" target=\"_blank\">cybersecurity risks</a> continue to rise, meaning you have to trust the companies who store your data even more. Proton's advantage is that it promises to NEVER use your content for any purpose&mdash;and those aren't empty words. Because the company doesn&rsquo;t have access to your content, it couldn't use it even if it wanted to. </p><h2>Choosing between Proton or Google Docs</h2><p>Ultimately, I think there are use cases for both services. While I love the privacy that Proton offers with Docs in Proton Drive, I think that Google Docs is a lot more convenient&mdash;as a lot more people have Google accounts than Proton accounts, making it easier to collaborate with them. </p><p>I also don&rsquo;t think that every document you make will always need the same level of end-to-end encryption that Proton is known for. In those cases, Google Docs is more than capable of protecting your document, so long as you follow all the usual security recommendations like two-factor authentication, using a strong password, and not giving anyone access to your account so that they can muck around in it.</p><p>Google Docs is also still integrated with all of Google&rsquo;s other office products on its side. Proton, on the other hand, only has Docs at the moment&mdash;though I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the company eventually offers an entire suite of privacy-first office tools, so you don't need other programs to open files you store with it. </p><p>But for your most secret information, say your next great American novel, Proton Docs make it easier than ever to keep it away from prying eyes.</p>"

						"__cdata": "<p>Charcoal and gas grills have dominated backyards in America for some time now, but there&rsquo;s a big, bold contender that&rsquo;s gaining popularity&mdash;the kamado grill. Granted, they've been around for a while now, so why are more folks turning away from the old favorites and opting to go full kamado? Well, there&rsquo;s a lot to love.&nbsp;</p><h2>What&rsquo;s different about the kamado grill?</h2><p><strong>Its egg-like shape.</strong> The first thing you&rsquo;ll notice about this Japanese grill is its unusual shape. A gas grill is tall and boxy, and a simple charcoal grill is just a metal holder with a grate on top&mdash;a kamado grill, by contrast, looks like a tall egg standing on its point. It&rsquo;s this tall funnel that allows oxygen to flow through the charcoal or wood, circulating the hot air up and around the food, and finally out the air vent in the lid. This design affords its user a more precise temperature control, and the deep base and dramatically domed lid allows for cooking a variety of large, small, and irregularly shaped items.</p><p><strong>Bye, metal.</strong> Kamado grills are often sold in beautiful, glossy, attention-grabbing shades, like forest green or cherry red. While you can absolutely find a colorful metal grill, there&rsquo;s something more vibrant about colorful ceramic. Yep, it&rsquo;s an egg-shaped grill made of thick ceramic. While that does make this a heavy option, ceramic is better at evenly heating with fewer hot spots. You probably won&rsquo;t toss this in the trunk for your monthly camping trips, but it makes for a great backyard centerpiece.</p><p><strong>Multi-style cooking abilities.</strong> A kamado grill can be used for high-heat searing, like for burgers and hot dogs, and the very next day set up to smoke a brisket low and slow. The temperature retention in a kamado grill is consistent enough to hold a baking temperature; you can bake a sourdough loaf, roast a pork loin, or knock up the temperature for crisp-crusted pizza.</p><h2>An expensive investment, but it'll last forever</h2><p>The biggest boon of a kamado grill is that it's economical, both in regards to the fuel and the grill itself. Ceramic gives you a long lifetime. This natural material won&rsquo;t warp or rust, and it can last for decades. Some companies, like <a href=\"https://www.kamadobbq.be/en/customer-support-shipping-and-pick-up/warranty-and-return/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Kamado Joe</u></a>, will even offer a lifetime warranty on the ceramic parts for this very reason&mdash;it should last!&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the thin metal lids of other grills, this ceramic vessel is thick and excellent for heat retention which means you&rsquo;ll go through less fuel. While kamado grills aren&rsquo;t cheap, they&rsquo;ll last you decades, require less fuel, and that&rsquo;s more money in your pocket in the long run.&nbsp;</p><h3>Kamado grills that might fit your size and budget needs:</h3><div class=\"shadow-b-2 mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-[#F0F0F0] px-6 py-2 shadow-lg md:px-12\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Products List\" x-data=\"{ showMore: false }\">\n                        <a href=\"https://cc.lifehacker.com/v1/otc/06ZVRiLmglGs4QA6plTXzTC?merchant=05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLondon-Sunshine-Ceramic-Charcoal-Kamado%2Fdp%2FB09479T5FK%2Fref%3Dasc_df_B09479T5FK%2F&amp;template=Explainers&amp;module=shop-card&amp;element=offer&amp;item=whole-shop-card&amp;position=&amp;element_label=London+Sunshine+Ceramic+Charcoal+Kamado+Grill+and+Smoker%2C+Tabletop+Cadet+Series&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss&amp;product_uuid=05QiWlrxinWhjY2x5zy7mx6&amp;offer_uuid=04R3NeyimMteLTogCGigDZO&amp;object_type=04R3NeyimMteLTogCGigDZO&amp;object_uuid=05QiWlrxinWhjY2x5zy7mx6\" data-commerce=\"1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" data-parent-group=\"affiliate-link\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\" class=\"flex flex-col py-8 gap-5 border-dotted border-[#CFCFCE] cursor-default no-underline md:flex-row md:gap-y-2 md:py-7 border-b-2\" data-ga-click=\"data-ga-click\" data-ga-item=\"whole-shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"London Sunshine Ceramic Charcoal Kamado Grill and Smoker, Tabletop Cadet Series\" aria-label=\"London Sunshine Ceramic Charcoal Kamado Grill and Smoker, Tabletop Cadet Series Product Card\" x-cloak=\"x-cloak\" x-show=\"showMore || 0 &lt;

						"__cdata": "<p>I understand why newsletters took off and RSS didn't. Most people are never going to download a dedicated app for reading news and take the time to set it up&mdash;but everyone has email. That doesn't change the fact that I, personally, prefer <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-rss-reader-apps-in-2024\" target=\"_blank\">an RSS reader</a> to keep up with news and another to manage my email. </p><p>The problem for people like me is that a lot of the best content out there is only available as a newsletter. Luckily, there's a compromise, of sorts. Most newsletter services provide an RSS feed&mdash;but if not, you can usually just make your own. </p><h2>Find existing RSS feeds for newsletters</h2><p>Most of the major newsletter services&mdash;Substack, Buttondown, Ghost, and BeeHiiv&mdash;offer some kind of RSS feed. And in the case of both Buttondown and BeeHiiv, the feed is generally easy to find&mdash;just look for the \"RSS\" option in the header. Click that to open the feed, which you can copy to your RSS reader of choice.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2CBA24588SFM5BZ14XA6MT0/images-1.fill.size_2000x503.v1720548919.png\" alt=\"The top bar of a Buttondown newsletter.

The simplest way to find the feed for Substack and Ghost newsletters is to head to the homepage for the newsletter and add <code>/feed</code> to the end of the URL. For example, if you wanted a feed for <code>https://annehelen.substack.com</code> you can find it at <code>https://annehelen.substack.com/feed</code>. Copy that and paste it into your RSS reader.</p><p>Of course, some newsletters are hosted using different services, and those might have different URLs for their RSS feed. In those cases you could try out <a href=\"https://rssfinder.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">RSS Finder</a>. This simple web app lets you paste any URL and get a list of feeds offered by that site.

Another worthy addition is the ethernet port; a wired connection to your router will offer the fastest speeds and best video quality.

How many times have you gone to get a fork out of a drawer only to find it's kind of gunky? All that work just to yield an ineffective result. It's not fair. You need products that make the whole thing easier <em>and </em>more effective. </p><h2>The best products for dishwashing </h2><p>We're going to start with the superstar, the holy grail, the king: the Scrub Daddy. My friends loved these way before I got on board and I thought it was all just a gimmick. Maybe they really liked that the sponge was in the shape of a smiley face. How deep could it be? But then I got one. The abrasive material really does get all the gunk off, plus the jagged edges fit into small spaces and the mouth hole is perfect for pulling utensils through for a 360-degree clean.

This makes your space look better, but also keeps it more organized. There are few circumstances where decanting is more warranted than when you're dealing with soap. When your hands are all wet and slippery, do you want to grab a plastic bottle, fidget with it, turn it over, and try to squeeze it? Get a dish soap dispenser. I got this wall-mounted, hands-free one for my mom and she is obsessed with how much easier it is to do the dishes when she can get soap in her hand or on her sponge without having to fiddle with a bottle. It's the little things, you know? (For the record, I won't tell you what kind of soap to actually use here, since everyone has their favorite and they all do basically the same thing, but I <em>will </em>say you can pry <a

I use it every day and it's been a game-changer. </p><div class=\"mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6\">\n    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Ddj2e?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Roundups&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=whole-shop-card&amp;element_label=BEAUTAIL%20Non-Scratch%20Scrub%20Sponges%20for%20Washing%20Dishes&amp;short_url=Ddj2e&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" data-commerce=\"1\" target=\"_blank\" data-parent-group=\"affiliate-link\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\" class=\"cursor-default no-underline\" data-ga-click=\"data-ga-click\" data-ga-item=\"whole-shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"BEAUTAIL Non-Scratch Scrub Sponges for Washing Dishes\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap justify-between px-7 text-black no-underline md:flex-nowrap md:px-8\">\n            <div class=\"order-1 mx-auto flex flex-col justify-center md:order-2 md:ml-4 md:w-full md:grow\">\n                <div class=\"block cursor-pointer text-center font-akshar text-2xl font-medium leading-7 text-brand-green duration-200 ease-in-out hover:text-brand-green-700 md:text-left md:text-xl md:leading-6\">BEAUTAIL Non-Scratch Scrub Sponges for Washing Dishes\n                </div>\n                                <div class=\"mt-4 hidden md:flex md:justify-between\">\n                                            <div class=\"self-end\">\n                            <div class=\"mb-0 h-11 md:flex md:flex-col md:justify-center\"><div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $5.99\n                            <span class=\"font-medium\">at Amazon </span>\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"flex items-center justify-center gap-x-1 font-bold md:justify-start\">\n            <span class=\"text-sm line-through\">$9.99</span>\n            <span class=\"text-sm text-brand-green\">Save $4.00</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"w-44 self-end\">\n                            <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Get Deal\n</button>\n                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 mt-5 h-auto w-full md:order-1 md:mt-0 md:hidden\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2C1W484KAYWQ8QYRJB6B221/images-4.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720539025.jpg\" alt=\"Silicone Sponge, BEAUTAIL Non-Scratch Scrub Sponges for Washing Dishes\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 ml-2 hidden w-32 shrink-0 items-center md:order-1 md:ml-0 md:flex\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2C1W484KAYWQ8QYRJB6B221/images-4.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720539025.jpg\" alt=\"Silicone Sponge, BEAUTAIL Non-Scratch Scrub Sponges for Washing Dishes\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-3 flex grow flex-wrap md:hidden md:grow-0\">\n                                    <div class=\"mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Get Deal\n</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"mx-2 mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $5.99\n                            <span class=\"font-medium\">at Amazon </span>\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"flex items-center justify-center gap-x-1 font-bold md:justify-start\">\n            <span class=\"text-sm line-through\">$9.99</span>\n            <span class=\"text-sm text-brand-green\">Save $4.00</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n</a></div>\n<p>As a result of how much I love my silicone sponge, I've been thinking of getting these silicone scrubbing gloves.

A real dishwasher is a luxury a small apartment dweller such as myself could only dream of, but even if you have one, you don't always want to load it up just for a few utensils and cups. This portable, USB-powered device foams up your water and creates a little vortex, washing smaller items for you while you handle bigger things. We're living in the future, baby. What a time to be alive. </p><div class=\"mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6\">\n    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/pgj34?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Roundups&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=whole-shop-card&amp;element_label=Portable%20Mini%20Sink%20Dishwasher%20with%20Auto%20Shutdown&amp;short_url=pgj34&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" data-commerce=\"1\" target=\"_blank\" data-parent-group=\"affiliate-link\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\" class=\"cursor-default no-underline\" data-ga-click=\"data-ga-click\" data-ga-item=\"whole-shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Portable Mini Sink Dishwasher with Auto Shutdown\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap justify-between px-7 text-black no-underline md:flex-nowrap md:px-8\">\n            <div class=\"order-1 mx-auto flex flex-col justify-center md:order-2 md:ml-4 md:w-full md:grow\">\n                <div class=\"block cursor-pointer text-center font-akshar text-2xl font-medium leading-7 text-brand-green duration-200 ease-in-out hover:text-brand-green-700 md:text-left md:text-xl md:leading-6\">Portable Mini Sink Dishwasher with Auto Shutdown\n                </div>\n                                <div class=\"mt-4 hidden md:flex md:justify-between\">\n                                            <div class=\"self-end\">\n                            <div class=\"mb-0 h-11 md:flex md:flex-col md:justify-center\"><div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $39.99\n                            <span class=\"font-medium\">at Amazon </span>\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"w-44 self-end\">\n                            <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Shop Now\n</button>\n                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 mt-5 h-auto w-full md:order-1 md:mt-0 md:hidden\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2C1W484KAYWQ8QYRJB6B221/images-7.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720539025.jpg\" alt=\"Mini USB Dishwasher, Portable Mini Sink Dishwasher with Auto Shutdown\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 ml-2 hidden w-32 shrink-0 items-center md:order-1 md:ml-0 md:flex\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2C1W484KAYWQ8QYRJB6B221/images-7.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720539025.jpg\" alt=\"Mini USB Dishwasher, Portable Mini Sink Dishwasher with Auto Shutdown\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-3 flex grow flex-wrap md:hidden md:grow-0\">\n                                    <div class=\"mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Shop Now\n</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"mx-2 mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $39.99\n                            <span class=\"font-medium\">at Amazon </span>\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n</a></div>\n<h2>The best tools for drying the dishes</h2><p>I have minimal counter space in my apartment, so I can't just set all my dishes out to dry whenever I finish washing.

When it comes to your flatware and utensils, your container is usually built right in, a cupboard or drawer of some kind, but \"out of sight, out of mind\" doesn't quite work here, since those can get really disorganized, even&mdash;and especially&mdash;when they're obscured from view. It's time to organize your dinnerware. </p><h2>The best tools for organizing utensils</h2><p>I overhauled my flatware and I haven't looked back. I don't know about you, but I don't have a lot of drawer space in my apartment, so for a long time, my silverware was arranged in a decorative vase. It did the job, but it didn't look great, plus it was sort of chaotic. I got this set of 24 forks, spoons, and knives, which come with their own holder to hang on. It all sits right on my countertop and, since the utensils have a pretty gold and pink finish, the whole display looks uniform and attractive. If you don't have a lot of drawer space, a matching set that can pass for decor might be your best option. </p><div class=\"mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6\">\n    <a

where they dry while they're hanging. I prefer that to leaving them to dry on a towel or something&mdash;or, worse, putting them back into a dark drawer a little damp. Still, if you have the counter space for drying and the drawer space for storage, congrats on having a bigger apartment than I do. Try these.</p><p>An expandable drawer organizer is your best option. When I've used a drawer to store my flatware, I've always just used a regular old molded organizer, but those never quite fit right and they bang around when you close the drawer, plus they create wasted space all around them. One that unfurls to fit whatever size drawer you have will save a lot of headaches.</p><div class=\"mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6\">\n    <a

But unlike those platforms, Etsy makes its money putting products in people's hands. It appears the company is trying to get ahead of the problem with new labels to help buyers better differentiate between handmade or vintage goods and AI-generated junk.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/news/protecting-and-strengthening-etsys-brand-mission\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>post</u></a> explaining new &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/legal/creativity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Creativity Standards</a>&rdquo; shared today, Etsy CEO Josh Silverman outlined a new requirement for sellers to label their products based on how involved they were in making them. For instance, a hand-knitted scarf would need a different label from a set of stickers produced using AI-generated art.</p><h2>How Etsy will label AI-generated products</h2><p>The four labels include &ldquo;Made by,&rdquo; &ldquo;Handpicked by,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sourced by,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Designed by,&rdquo; and sellers can get in trouble for using the wrong one. The first three labels would cover more traditional Etsy fare, like &ldquo;handpicked&rdquo; vintage clothing, &ldquo;sourced&rdquo; party supplies, or &ldquo;made&rdquo; jewelry. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Designed by&rdquo; label that&rsquo;s targeting AI.</p><p>While Silverman&rsquo;s blog post simply says that a product using the &ldquo;Designed&rdquo; category must be &ldquo;designed by a seller,&rdquo; Etsy&rsquo;s updated <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/seller-handbook/article/1275449912004\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Seller Handbook</u></a> says that sellers using this label can &ldquo;use their original prompts in combination with AI tools to create the artwork they sell on Etsy.&rdquo;</p><p>So, while AI isn&rsquo;t being disallowed, it is being more clearly distinguished. That said, those selling designed work that doesn&rsquo;t use AI, such as original digital artwork or 3D prints made with an outside production partner, will fall under the same category.</p><p>Etsy does say that &ldquo;Sellers must disclose within their listing description if an item is created with the use of AI,&rdquo; although buyers will need to click through to see this language. It&rsquo;s also unclear how Etsy's process for detecting and reprimanding violators will work.</p><h2>\"Keep commerce human\"</h2><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not allowing new items that we prohibited before,&rdquo; Silverman&rsquo;s post clarifies, but one type of AI-associated product<em> is</em> getting the axe: Etsy currently has <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/search?q=ai+prompts&amp;ref=pagination&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>pages of listings for AI prompts</u></a> being sold for anywhere from $1 to $200, and it seems like the platform has had enough&mdash;a new rule in the Seller Handbook says, &ldquo;we do not allow items that simply offer packages of prompts.&rdquo;</p><p>Etsy&rsquo;s handmade approach is a big part of what differentiates it from stores like Shein and Temu, so it makes sense that the company would want to put up some guardrails. While the messaging in Silverman&rsquo;s statement and in the new Seller Handbook is fairly non-confrontational, the large &ldquo;Keep Commerce Human&rdquo; banner at the top of the announcement makes the company&rsquo;s AI frustrations clear.</p>"

On Wednesday, July 10 on its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung/videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">YouTube Channel</a>, Samsung will unveil the next generation of some Galaxy devices, including the successors to the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-samsung-s-galaxy-watc-1850680274\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy Watch 6</a>, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-we-know-about-samsungs-galaxy-ring\" target=\"_blank\">a new smart ring</a>, as well as the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Z Flip 6. That's standard practice for the company's summer announcements, with updates for its non-folding phones set to come later. But you don't need to wait until Unpacked to check out the new foldables, either: They've basically totally leaked. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191966/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-6-spec-leak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">As reported by The Verge</a>, leaker Evan Blass shared Samsung's promotional materials and spec sheets for both the Z Flip 6 and the Z Fold 6. If these documents are legit (and they appear to be), we're getting our first look at Samsung's new foldables half a week early. </p><p>Spoiler alert: Samsung hasn't made any <em>monumental</em> changes to either the Z Fold or the Z Flip here. These are very much subtle updates. But there are some interesting features to note.</p><h2>Galaxy Z Flip 6</h2><p>Samsung's latest flip phone looks to be similar to the Z Flip 5, albeit slightly lighter and thinner. The leaked marketing materials show off some interesting new features, like an addition to Interpreter Mode that displays the translated text on the front display; a new 50MP camera, up from 12MP from the Z Flip 5; and a vapor chamber for cooling. </p><p>Here's what the phone looks like on paper, according to the alleged leaks:</p><ul><li><p>Display: 6.7-inch 2640 x 1080 OLED with a refresh rate of 120Hz (main), 3.4-inch 720 x 748 IPS (front)</p></li><li><p>Cameras: 12MP ultra-wide, 50MP wide, 10MP front</p></li><li><p>Battery: 4,000 mAh, up to 23 hours of video playback</p></li><li><p>SoC: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, 12GB RAM </p></li><li><p>Storage: 256GB</p></li></ul><h2>Galaxy Z Fold 6</h2><p>At first glance, Samsung isn't adding as many new features to the Z Fold 6 as it is with the Z Flip 6, according to The Verge. The Z Fold 6 doesn't get the additional Interpreter Mode, or the vapor chamber for cooling. </p><p>However, there are some interesting changes over last year's Z Fold 5: The display will allegedly reach 2,600 nits of brightness, compared to the Z Fold 5's maximum of 1,750 nits. Like the Z Flip 6, the Z Fold 6 will also get the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which Samsung says has an NPU increase of 42% (the part of the chip that processes AI). Samsung is also touting new AI features, such as a new AI zoom, that should theoretically result in clearer closeups. </p><p>In addition, the Z Fold 6 is also thinner and lighter than past models, and has a new aluminum frame. All that said, there aren't any radical changes here: If you have a Z Fold 5 (or perhaps an older Z Fold device) you might not feel a huge push to upgrade. </p><ul><li><p>Displays: 7.6-inch 2160 x 1856 OLED with a refresh rate of 120Hz (main), 6.3-inch OLED (front)</p></li><li><p>Cameras: 12MP ultra-wide (F2.2), 50MP (F1.8), 10MP (F2.4)</p></li><li><p>Battery: 4,400 mAh, up to 23 hours of video playback</p></li><li><p>SoC: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, 12GB RAM</p></li><li><p>Storage: 512GB </p></li></ul>"

						"__cdata": "<p>We all have our reasons for separating the yolks from the egg whites&mdash;dietary restrictions, flavor preferences&mdash;and a slapdash crack-and-dump usually does the trick. A little broken yolk isn&rsquo;t a big deal. But there is that one scenario when a bit of yolk can really ruin everything: meringue. A little blob of broken egg yolk can keep a meringue from reaching peak fluff potential.</p><h2>The trouble with yolks</h2><p>A properly whipped batch of egg whites can be the central ingredient for a fluffy omelet, ethereal pancakes, airy Japanese cheesecakes, a crunchy pavlova, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/lemon-pudding-cake-recipe\" target=\"_blank\">this lemon pudding cake</a>. Sadly, the fatty egg yolk (or any fat) can interfere with the formation of the egg white foam, causing it to take longer to whip and be less robust. If enough fat is introduced, it&rsquo;ll never get past the loose foamy stage. The worst case scenario for large batch recipes is when you drop a glob of yolk into a bowl of six or seven successfully separated whites. Somehow, it&rsquo;s always the last egg, so you feel like you&rsquo;ve lost the whole bowl. Thankfully, one of these two tricks can change that.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to clean up your \"dirty\" egg whites</h2><p><strong>Use a leftover egg shell half:</strong> When it comes to fishing out egg parts in a bowl of eggs, nothing works better. I tried this trick on a hunch when the cotton swab method (below) left behind some mini-blobs of yolk. The best way to fish an elusive shard of eggshell out of your morning scramble prep is to use a large piece of egg shell, so why wouldn&rsquo;t the same method work for wayward yolk? </p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2BW6GX2ND2N41X3Z2CC2QJT/images-2.fill.size_2000x1124.v1720533074.jpg\" alt=\"An egg shell scooping up egg yolks in a bowl of whites.\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1124\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2BW6GX2ND2N41X3Z2CC2QJT/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1720533074.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2BW6GX2ND2N41X3Z2CC2QJT/images-2.fill.size_1400x787.v1720533074.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J2BW6GX2ND2N41X3Z2CC2QJT/images-2.fill.size_2000x1124.v1720533074.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\">The egg shell easily sweeps up multiple streaks of yolks.</span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>I dipped a discarded half-shell into the egg white near the yolk streaks and they flew right in. Yes, I lost a little bit of white in the process but it was truly minimal, and it&rsquo;s a worthwhile sacrifice for properly whipped whites.&nbsp;This will even work for large-size blobs of egg yolk.</p><p><strong>Use a cotton swab.</strong> This tool is good if you notice just a speck of egg yolk has invaded your bowl of whites and the discarded shells are gone or covered in yolk. I saw this tip from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/testkitchen/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>America&rsquo;s Test Kitchen&rsquo;s Instagram</u></a>, so I assumed it would work like a magical yolk vacuum.

It should cling to the cotton tip.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to avoid the problem</h2><p>The best way to keep your egg whites pristine is to prevent the yolks from breaking in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t juggle the yolks from shell to shell.</strong> I am guilty of this, and so is the person in the lead picture of this article. I'll successfully separate two eggs, be coaxed into a false sense of security, and it always comes back to bite me. The shell's edge is sharp and jagged. I don&rsquo;t care how much experience you have, it&rsquo;s probably the easiest way to screw up the yolks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Your hands are the best tool.</strong> The easiest, gadget-less way to do it is to use your fingers as a sieve instead. Crack the egg into your non-dominant hand and let the white fall through. Then you can pinch off the stubborn whites with your fingers while still gently cradling the yolk.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Always crack over an intermediary bowl.</strong> Once you&rsquo;re confident the white in that bowl is clean, dump it in the actual mixing bowl. Repeat. Then if you do accidentally rip apart an egg yolk in there, the mixing bowl of whites is still usable. Get a new bowl to crack a new egg, and keep the busted one for a snack.&nbsp;</p>"

						"__cdata": "<p>In the world of personal finance, signature loans stand out as a unique and straightforward borrowing option. Also known as \"good faith loans\" or \"character loans,\" these financial products offer a way for individuals to secure funds based primarily on their creditworthiness and promise to repay. </p><h2>What is a signature loan?</h2><p>A signature loan is a type of <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/what-is-an-unsecured-loan\" target=\"_blank\">unsecured personal loan</a> that is backed solely by the borrower's signature as a promise to repay. Unlike secured loans that require collateral, such as a car or house, signature loans rely on the borrower's creditworthiness and income. This makes them an attractive option for those who need funds but don't want to risk their assets.</p><p>Signature loans typically come with fixed interest rates and set repayment terms. This means borrowers know exactly how much they'll need to pay each month and for how long. The loan amounts can vary widely, often ranging from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands, depending on the lender and the borrower's qualifications.</p><h2>How signature loans work</h2><p>The process of obtaining a signature loan is pretty straightforward. To start, a potential borrower applies for the loan, typically providing information about their income, employment, and existing debts. The lender will also perform a credit check to assess the applicant's credit history and score.</p><p>If approved, the lender will offer loan terms, including the interest rate, loan amount, and repayment period. These terms are largely based on the borrower's creditworthiness and income. Borrowers with excellent credit scores and stable, high incomes often qualify for the best rates and terms.</p><p>Once the borrower accepts the terms and signs the loan agreement, the funds are typically disbursed quickly, often within a few business days. The borrower then begins making regular payments according to the agreed-upon schedule until the loan is fully repaid.</p><h2>Advantages of signature loans</h2><p>Signature loans offer several benefits that make them attractive to many borrowers:</p><p>1. <strong>Flexibility</strong>: The funds from a signature loan can be used for almost any purpose, from consolidating debt to funding a major purchase.</p><p>2. <strong>Quick approval</strong>: With minimal documentation required, signature loans often have a faster approval process compared to secured loans.</p><p>3. <strong>No collateral required</strong>: Borrowers don't need to put up any assets as collateral, reducing the risk of losing personal property.</p><p>4. <strong>Fixed payments</strong>: The fixed interest rate and set repayment term make budgeting easier for borrowers.</p><h2>Potential drawbacks of signature loans</h2><p>While signature loans offer many advantages, they also come with some drawbacks to consider.</p><p>1. <strong>Higher interest rates</strong>: Because they're unsecured, signature loans typically carry higher interest rates than secured loans.</p><p>2. <strong>Credit score impact</strong>: As with any loan, failure to make timely payments can negatively impact the borrower's credit score.</p><p>3. <strong>Qualification challenges</strong>: Those with <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-get-a-credit-card-with-bad-credit\" target=\"_blank\">poor credit</a> or inconsistent income may find it difficult to qualify for a signature loan, or may face less-favorable terms. Across the board, loan rejections are up&mdash;<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-its-never-been-more-important-to-have-a-good-credit-1850857840\" target=\"_blank\">here's what you can do to improve your approval odds</a>.</p><h2>Who should consider a signature loan?</h2><p>Signature loans can be a good option for individuals with good credit who need funds for a specific purpose and prefer not to use collateral. They're often used for <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/the-pros-and-cons-of-debt-consolidation\" target=\"_blank\">debt consolidation</a>, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-cheapest-alternatives-to-expensive-home-improvement-1850181860\" target=\"_blank\">home improvements</a>, or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/six-ways-to-handle-unexpected-expenses\" target=\"_blank\">unexpected expenses</a>.</p><p>However, it's crucial for potential borrowers to carefully consider their ability to repay the loan and compare offers from multiple lenders to ensure they're getting the best possible terms.</p><p>According to debt attorney <a href=\"https://attorney-newyork.com/about-us/in-the-news/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Leslie Tayne, </a>the best signature loan rates today can be found for as low as 5% to 6%, though many lenders start their rates around 7% to 9%. Tayne says these rates are reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers or those with &ldquo;very good&rdquo; credit scores of around 740 and up. \"These borrowers have demonstrated past behaviors that indicate they are low-risk,\" explains Tayne. \"They generally pay their bills on time, maintain low debt balances, and don&rsquo;t rely too heavily on credit.\"</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, borrowers with poor credit can expect to pay upwards of 30% for an unsecured personal loan. These <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/punishments-for-not-paying-debts\" target=\"_blank\">borrowers have had issues</a> with missed payments in the past and even collections or bankruptcies. \"Because of these past problems managing debt,\" says Tayne, \"they present a high level of risk for lenders and face subprime interest rates.\"</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>Signature loans offer a straightforward borrowing option for those who prefer not to put up collateral. By understanding how these loans work, their advantages, and potential drawbacks, borrowers can make informed decisions about whether a signature loan is the right financial tool for their needs. As with any financial decision, it's wise to carefully consider one's personal financial situation and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/heres-when-its-time-to-call-a-financial-advisor-1850053476\" target=\"_blank\">consult with a financial advisor</a> if needed before taking on new debt.</p>"

At some point in your life you got your first paycheck and you needed someplace to put it, so you opened a bank account. When we think about banking we usually focus on getting the best interest rates and the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/these-banks-reimburse-atm-fees-1848982111\" target=\"_blank\">lowest fees</a> we can find, which usually leads us to a big, national bank.</p><p>Big banks offer a lot of convenience&mdash;you can usually contact them at any time, they offer a broad range of services, and you can manage most of your financial life on your phone. That&rsquo;s great, but smaller, local banks (<a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/cbi/report/CBSI-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">defined</a> by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [FDIC] as a bank with less than $1 billion in assets) aren&rsquo;t just smaller&mdash;they also offer a lot of benefits that larger, national or online banks can&rsquo;t.</p><h2>Lower rates &amp; fees</h2><p>It can be expensive just to have a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/all-the-ways-your-bank-will-try-to-rip-you-off-1850312694\" target=\"_blank\">bank account</a>. Between ATM fees and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-difference-between-overdraft-and-non-sufficient-fun-1850244606\" target=\"_blank\">overdraft fees</a>, it can feel like you&rsquo;re paying rent to park your money someplace.</p><p>Local banks usually offer much lower fees, and fewer of them, than national banks. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-research-shows-banks-deep-dependence-on-overdraft-fees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">found</a> that overdraft fees at smaller banks are as much as 19% lower than at large banks. And this is true for the other side of that coin&mdash;interest rates. If you need a credit card, you&rsquo;re probably better off working with a local bank, where interest rates are typically <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-report-finds-large-banks-charge-higher-credit-card-interest-rates-than-small-banks-and-credit-unions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">8-10 points <em>lower</em></a> than at larger banks. And local banks charge annual fees a lot less often as well. That can translate to a <em>lot</em> of saved money over the course of a year.</p><h2>Better service</h2><p>Your big bank doesn&rsquo;t really care about you&mdash;or even know who you are. That&rsquo;s why banks sometimes <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-prevent-your-bank-from-closing-your-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">close your account</a> without explanation and force you to navigate confusing phone menus when you call their supposedly 24-hour customer service line. A local bank will offer you much more personalized service, including face-to-face customer service when you need it. That&rsquo;s one big reason why local banks generally score a <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/banking/benefits-of-local-banks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">net 74% customer satisfaction rating</a>, compared to just 56% for larger banks&mdash;and an abysmal 40% for online banks.</p><p>That more-personal service can impact more than just your satisfaction as a customer. When you need a loan, local banks often prioritize &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.icba.org/about/community-banking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">relationship banking</a>.&rdquo; This means they take more than just your credit score and net worth into consideration when you need to borrow money&mdash;they&rsquo;ll consider your relationship with the bank, your spending history, and the potential impact of the loan on the community itself. That can make it easier to borrow money&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll probably get a lower rate as well.</p><h2>Benefits to community </h2><p>Finally, local banks aren&rsquo;t just banks&mdash;they are members of your local business community. As such, they have a vested interest in investing in that community. Larger banks are usually focused more on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/21/banks-record-profits-windfall-tax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">making profits</a> from their investments&mdash;investments that typically have little to no impact on your community&mdash;but small, local banks are usually more focused on &ldquo;productive investments.&rdquo; Local banks make <a href=\"https://ilsr.org/articles/small-business-lending-by-size-of-institution-2014/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">more than half the loans</a> to small businesses, so your money is being used to directly benefit your local area. This also benefits you because a local bank will know the community intimately, which can be a compelling factor when you&rsquo;re seeking a loan or investment for a business or service that will benefit the local area.</p>"

The A1 has a big &ldquo;stop&rdquo; button on the front, which will pop open the settings panel on top of the mower.

set-up</h2><p>Getting the A1 online was, for lack of a better term, miserable. The first mower I received already had a PIN set that support couldn&rsquo;t reset or tell me the code for, so back it went. The second mower I was able to set a PIN for, but had hours of trouble getting to pair via Bluetooth or wifi after that. The answer from support was that the only PIN that would work is 0001, which defeats the purpose of a PIN. Once I reset the PIN and suffered through many hours closing the app, dumping the cache, reopening it and getting a tiny bit further in the software updating and pairing process, it was finally time to send the robot out on its maiden voyage.&nbsp;</p><p>Robot lawnmowers do this in different ways: Some try to use LiDAR for this purpose (I didn&rsquo;t find it very effective on the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/goat-gx-600-robot-lawn-mower-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>GOAT</u></a>). But most (and my preferred way) use the app like a remote control, walking the robot around the perimeter of the yard to set the boundary. The A1 combines these two methods, which I think is a good idea. Let users map the boundary and <em>then</em> have the lawnbot use LiDAR to navigate within the boundary. Still, I struggled to get the boundary set on the A1 as well, due to the lack of explanation or nuance in the error codes the robot threw. There&rsquo;s a pre-flight checklist before you can set your first boundary, and whether your robot is on the charging dock or not (it turns out both could be the problem), it still says, &ldquo;robot not on dock.&rdquo; After some more support calls, I was able to get the robot out on a boundary run. I mapped the backyard, which is largely a big open space with one obstacle (a fire pit) in the center.&nbsp;</p><h2>Once actually mowing, the A1 performs pretty well</h2><p>The mower did a good job when it was actually mowing, heading out in a U-shaped pattern back and forth (checkerboard enthusiasts will be disappointed, as it&rsquo;s not an option, but perimeter mowing or spot mowing is). I saw very few stray blades, and the cut came close to the fence. You can set the height between approximately one to three inches. The A1 also did a good job with slight dips and hills, which other mowers, like the Navimow, struggled with&mdash;but it was not as resilient as the Luba 2, getting stuck on a slightly more exaggerated dip the Luba sailed over. The A1 did navigate around the fire pit easily, but like the Luba 2, was too conservative in how big a space it left unmowed around the pit. The Navimow was able to get closer to obstacles.&nbsp;</p><p>The A1 lets you schedule your mowing too. This feature worked as expected, except when it rained or became dark during the runtime. Usually the robot would return to the charging station at that point, and complete the job on the next run or the next day. The A1 just stopped where it was, stranded, and would not return to the base. This is problematic, of course, because if the mower is stranded on your front lawn, it&rsquo;s easy to steal. Otherwise, the mower did a good job finding the base when it was done with a run, and though that sounds simple, the GOAT routinely failed at the same job.&nbsp;</p><p>Having some success in the backyard, I added the front yard to the A1, since the A1 can handle multiple &ldquo;zones,&rdquo; which not all mowers do. This allows you to divide the areas you want to mow so you can treat them differently. This is a far more complicated area, with lots of flower beds to be avoided, and I wanted to see how the A1 would do in terms of avoidance. Minus a few strawberry plants that grew out of their area, the A1 did a respectable job. It struggled around corners of the planting beds, getting stuck on the sides of the bed itself and had trouble dislodging itself. This ability to handle multiple zones means that you could consider <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-should-share-robot-lawn-mower-with-neighbors\" target=\"_blank\">sharing this robot with your neighbors</a>. </p><h2>Lack of security features is a concern</h2><p>A major swing and miss on the A1 is the security system. If you pick the mower up, it sounds an unpleasant alarm, which is good if it&rsquo;s a robber picking it up but terrible if you&rsquo;re just towing it back to the base because it keeps getting stranded. Either way, it&rsquo;s not a very effective deterrent. The best deterrent, in my opinion, is a 4g sim integrated into the hardware, and an app feature that uses the sim for GPS, ensuring that if the mower is taken, you can pinpoint the location.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bottom line: It's not ready yet</h2><p>The nice thing is that all the problems I experienced with the A1 were software, not hardware-related. This means there&rsquo;s some chance that via updates, the problems could get resolved. In Dreame&rsquo;s favor, I could always reach phone support, even on a holiday, and even if they were not always particularly helpful. At full price (about $2,600),&nbsp;I think there are better mowers out there right now for &frac12; acre, which is what the A1 will cover. Grab a Luba 2 that will cover <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/JdOED?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Reviews&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=.75%20acres%20for%20%242%2C500&amp;short_url=JdOED&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>.75 acres for $2,500</u></a>, or <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/8BRNq?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Reviews&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=.25%20acres%20for%20approximately%20%242%2C100&amp;short_url=8BRNq&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>.25 acres for approximately $2,100</u></a>, or grab a .<a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Py0EZ?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Reviews&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=25%20acre%20Navimow&amp;short_url=Py0EZ&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>25 acre Navimow</u></a> for about half that.</p>"

Affinity, a pro-level creative suite owned by graphic design company Canva, is now <a href=\"https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/press/newsroom/try-affinity-designer-photo-and-publisher-free-for-six-months/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">offering a six-month free trial</a> for three of its products that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-photoshop-alternatives\" target=\"_blank\">directly compete with Adobe's tools</a>&mdash;Affinity Photo, Affinity Designer, and Affinity Publisher. These products are alternatives to Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, respectively.</p><h2>How to sign up for the Affinity free trial</h2><p>Affinity's universal license includes Photo, Designer, and Publisher. Simply navigate to <a href=\"https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/#universal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">this page</a> to sign up for the trial. Oncer there, click the <strong>Free Trial</strong> button and use your email address to sign up. Once you install Affinity's apps, you'll be able to use them for six months with no charge. The company said it's not asking for payment information to sign up for the trial, which means that you won't have to remember to cancel the trial if you're not ready to pay. </p><p>In you like what you're seeing after a few days of use, you can buy the entire suite at 50% off right now, which means that you'll be paying $83 for the Mac, iPad, and Windows versions of all three apps. The regular price for the suite is $165.</p><p>Why would you want to swap to Affinity? Well, there are no subscriptions involved with Affinity's products. You pay a one-time fee and you're free to use the apps for as long as you like. Affinity will only charge you if you choose to upgrade to new versions as they come out. Even as your suite becomes outdated, you're free to continue using the software you paid for, although the company will likely provide you a discount to help you upgrade.</p><h2>What the Adobe controversy is all about</h2><p>As for what the Adobe outrage was all about, people were upset with Adobe's terms of service, which implied that the company could use your work to train its generative AI. Adobe responded to criticism by saying that it doesn't use your work to train generative AI and that it doesn't scan any content you store locally. The company also allows you to opt out of AI training, but as it still has access to your data, this hasn't been enough to quell some people's complaints.&nbsp;There's also concerns that cloud-based content might be aggregated with other user content to train \"algorithms.\"</p><p>A few days after Adobe issued a clarification about the AI training uproar, the U.S. government then sued the company for charging hidden fees and making it hard to cancel subscriptions. Adobe's subscription fee practices include pushing people towards big annual subscription bundles that include apps they may not always need. Adobe would also charge you a cancellation fee amounting to up to 50% of your remaining payments, <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/06/ftc-says-adobe-hid-key-terms-annual-paid-monthly-subscription-plan-set-roadblocks-deter-customer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">according to the FTC</a>.&nbsp;</p>"

For <strong>$169</strong> (originally $279) you get the same ANC as the QuietComfort Ultra for almost half the price, although there are a couple of caveats. There is no way to turn off the ANC with these earbuds, but you can always turn on Aware mode if you want to be able to hear your surroundings. You also only get between six and seven hours of juice with these earbuds, but the charging case can provide about 18 hours of additional battery life. </p><h2>Best AirPod deals for early Prime Day</h2><p>If you're looking for AirPods, consider the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/V0NNx?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Deals&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20Max&amp;short_url=V0NNx&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Apple AirPods Max</a>, starting at about <strong>$399</strong> (originally $549), depending on the color.

						"__cdata": "<p>Fame works differently than it used to. Very few people are famous to everyone, but there are a host of YouTube creators, Instagram influencers, and TikTokers who are household-name-famous to the under-25 set, but completely unknown to everyone else. Some people, like White Tube Top Girl, become instantly famous for no reason at all, and some really work at it and are super-talented, like Chappell Roan, but the almighty algorithm of fame gives no points for effort.</p><h2>Who is Chappell Roan? </h2><p>Chappell Roan is a 26-year-old singer from Missouri. Her musical style is heavily informed by 1980s synth-pop and Kate Bush, and her look is informed by drag queens (or <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/pop-culture/chappell-roan-style-influenced-by-miss-piggy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Miss Piggy,</a> depending on who you ask.) At 17, she was plucked from obscurity after posting a video on YouTube for her song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PXz2gNNR9o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Die Young</a>,&rdquo; and signed to Atlantic Records. Her EP didn&rsquo;t sell well, and Atlantic cut the cord. But Roan re-emerged in 2023 with a full-length album, <em>The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,</em> released on Island Record, and it was a slow burn from there. Roan grew her fanbase by opening for Olivia Rodrigo, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4WiXKGCJhg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">appearing on NPR,</a> and turning in killer performances at&nbsp;festivals. All that hard work paid off when the record hit  #5 on the Billboard charts a year or so after it was released. And that&rsquo;s where we are now: Roan is on the verge of superstardom, famous enough now that even you and I have heard of her.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who is White Tube Top Girl?</h2><p>While Chappell Roan definitely put in the hours for her stardom, the all-powerful TikTok created a superstar from thin air this week: White Tube Top Girl. Her name is Faith Marie, and her meteoric rise began (and ended) when she posted a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@faith.marie19/video/7387161243892698411\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">brief dance video</a>. For reasons that are beyond the understanding of humans, the not-remarkable-in-any-way video took off, resulting in over 23 million views in its first week online, and a ton of responses. Mainly from people asking &ldquo;what is this even?&rdquo; Or, as a commenter on Faith Marie&rsquo;s video put it: &ldquo;okay wait i&rsquo;m confused what&rsquo;s all the hype about.&rdquo; One possible answer: The video is so popular because it's so mediocre. Marie is not a particularly good dancer; she doesn&rsquo;t say or do anything out of the ordinary; she didn't even invent the dance. On the surface, it's the same as 100 million other low-effort videos. But maybe Faith Marie is being fed to TikTok&rsquo;s users because Marie has achieved some rare level of perfect averageness, the great mid-ness that all attempts to gain the most eyeballs achieves. If so, White Tube Top Girl is a look into our dystopian entertainment future. </p><h2>What is the One Million Beers meme?</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t really understand the joke of the &ldquo;One Million Beers&rdquo; meme, but here&rsquo;s what it is: TikTok users are posting videos of themselves using a handsome filter, where they walk up to a bar and either order one million beers, or order another drink and the bartender offers a million beers instead.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@zackenyon/video/7378345695796923691\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">first video using the phrase</a>. This apparently impressed people enough that they began to imitate it and expand on the concept, including the most popular variation: A dude (or dudes) order a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@nevdawgg/video/7387236769034472747\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Red Bull and vodka</a> or some food or something, and the &ldquo;handsome&rdquo; bartender or waiter responds by asking &ldquo;did you ask for one million beers?&rdquo; And begins <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@theajcorrado/video/7387922159655488811\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">piling beers on the table</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Like White Tube Top Girl, the One Million Beers meme makes me wonder if something is wrong with TikTok or something is wrong with TikTok&rsquo;s users. It&rsquo;s a mystery.&nbsp;</p><h2>TikTok dangers</h2><p>Not everything is wrong with TikTok&mdash;the platform seems to have gotten much better at identifying and deleting videos that encourage dangerous behavior over the last few years. But people with bad ideas are ingenious and have routed around bans on physically dangerous activities like The Milk Crate Challenge by focusing on bad <em>ideas</em> instead. Here are some of those bad ideas,  all of which illustrate things you should never do:</p><ul><li><p>Do not <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/cars/1920274/save-petrol-tiktok-hack-risk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">tailgate other drivers </a>to save fuel. While it might work, it&rsquo;s dangerous and annoying.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Do not listen to<a href=\"https://www.newschannel5.com/news/dermatologists-face-impact-of-online-trends-as-anti-sunscreen-movements-trend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"> people who tell you not to wear sunscreen</a>. I wrote a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/what-people-are-getting-wrong-this-week-is-sunscreen-bad-for-you\" target=\"_blank\">whole thing about it,</a> but boiled down: The sun will give you cancer if you don&rsquo;t wear sunscreen. Also: <a href=\"https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/health/experts-issue-stark-warning-over-9395679\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Don&rsquo;t make your own sunscreen</a>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Do not take <a href=\"https://www.dentistryiq.com/practice-management/patient-communication-and-patient-financing/article/55094114/patients-should-avoid-these-6-tiktok-dental-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">dentistry advice from TikTok</a>. Avoid DIY dentistry completely; that means don&rsquo;t file your teeth, don&rsquo;t practice home orthodontia, and don&rsquo;t put in your own fillings.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Do not try to <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/parasite-cleanse-why-experts-are-warning-about-this-tiktok-health-trend/ar-BB1oIkhu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">cleanse your gut of parasites</a> if you don&rsquo;t have parasites.</p></li></ul><h2>Viral video of the week: &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo; Kendrick Lamar</h2><p>Thankfully, Kendrick Lamar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo; video proves that everything popular online isn't average. The video has been viewed over 36 million times in four days, and at least one of those views was probably from Drake checking in. It&rsquo;s a bad time to be Drake. The rapper must have just been getting over the savage verbal beating he took last month at the hands of Lamar, only to wake up on July 4th to the full video of &ldquo;Not Like Us.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-H58vbez_m4E\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought it possible, but the full version of the song is even more brutal than the mix-tape version. More catchy and exuberant. More honest and cool. This is definitely the song of the summer, but if you&rsquo;re Drake, the song of the summer is about how horrible you are. Even if it&rsquo;s about you, you&rsquo;d have to recognize how great it is&mdash;it&rsquo;s undeniable. Imagine trying not to bob your head to this song because it accuses you of being both a colonizer and a pedophile.</p>"

Larger vacuum attachments aren't great for this, especially if you have a really small track or one with a bunch of levels and components inside. If that's the case, grab a cardboard tube, the kind you get when you run out of toilet paper. You just stick it to the end of your vacuum like you would any other attachment, as shown <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/acleanbee/reel/CzcAIDuvmqK/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>in this Instagram Reel</u></a> from A Clean Bee. Bend the edge of the roll to make a slit and shove it into the small space. It works <em>really</em> well for pulling dirt out of crevices.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2HH9RXG5XXSY5BY2R1MYMC/images-1.fill.size_2000x1121.v1720468446.png\" alt=\"Cleaning a door slider with a tube\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1121\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2HH9RXG5XXSY5BY2R1MYMC/images-1.fill.size_800x448.v1720468446.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2HH9RXG5XXSY5BY2R1MYMC/images-1.fill.size_1400x784.v1720468446.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2HH9RXG5XXSY5BY2R1MYMC/images-1.fill.size_2000x1121.v1720468446.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\"></span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Lindsey Ellefson</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Then take your baking soda and sprinkle a fine layer of powder to thoroughly cover the track. Next, grab your hydrogen peroxide and pour it onto the metal track and let it sit for five to 10 minutes.

A new puzzle goes live every day at midnight, your local time.</p><p>Start by guessing a five-letter word.

(We also have more information at the bottom of this post, after the hints and answers.)</p><p>Ready for the hints? Let&rsquo;s go!</p><hr><h2>Does today&rsquo;s Wordle have any unusual letters?</h2><p>We&rsquo;ll define common letters as those that appear in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etaoin_shrdlu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>old typesetters&rsquo; phrase</u></a> ETAOIN SHRDLU.

Today&rsquo;s word is BLARE.</p><h2>How I solved today&rsquo;s Wordle</h2><p>I started with RAISE then guessed BLAND assuming I wasn't looking for any additional vowels and needed to eliminate common consonants. From here, the answer was obvious: BLARE. </p><pre class=\"border-2 border-gray-400 bg-gray-100 p-4 text-black shadow-md\">Wordle 1,116 3/6\n\n&#129000;&#129000;&#11035;&#11035;&#129001;\n&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;&#11035;&#11035;\n&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;</pre>\n<hr><h2>Yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle answer</h2><p>Yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle was medium difficult. The hint was &ldquo;to form, mold, or create&rdquo; and the answer contained four common letters and one fairly common letters. </p><p>The answer to yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle was SHAPE. </p><h2>A primer on Wordle basics</h2><p>The idea of Wordle is to guess the day&rsquo;s secret word. When you first open the Wordle game, you&rsquo;ll see an empty grid of letters. It&rsquo;s up to <em>you</em> to make the first move: type in any five-letter word.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, you can use the colors that are revealed to get clues about the word:&nbsp;<strong>Green</strong> means you correctly guessed a letter, and it&rsquo;s in the correct position. (For example, if you guess PARTY, and the word is actually PURSE, the P and R will be green.)</p><ul><li><p><strong>Yellow</strong> means the letter is somewhere in the word, but not in the position you guessed it. (For example, if you guessed PARTY, but the word is actually ROAST, the R, A and T will all be yellow.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Gray</strong> means the letter is not in the solution word at all. (If you guessed PARTY and everything is gray, then the solution <em>cannot</em> be PURSE or ROAST.)</p></li></ul><p>With all that in mind, guess another word, and then another, trying to land on the correct word before you run out of chances. You get six guesses, and then it&rsquo;s game over.</p><h2>The best starter words for Wordle</h2><p>What should you play for that first guess? The best starters tend to contain common letters, to increase the chances of getting yellow and green squares to guide your guessing. (And if you get all grays when guessing common letters, that&rsquo;s <em>still</em> excellent information to help you rule out possibilities.) There isn&rsquo;t a single &ldquo;best&rdquo; starting word, but the New York Times&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/this-bot-can-tell-you-how-good-you-really-are-at-wordle-1848769075\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Wordle analysis bot</u></a> has suggested starting with one of these:</p><ul><li><p>CRANE</p></li><li><p>TRACE</p></li><li><p>SLANT</p></li><li><p>CRATE</p></li><li><p>CARTE</p></li></ul><p>Meanwhile, an MIT analysis <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/science-thinks-it-has-found-the-best-wordle-starter-1849541276\" target=\"_blank\"><u>found</u></a> that you&rsquo;ll eliminate the most possibilities in the first round by starting with one of these:</p><ul><li><p>SALET</p></li><li><p>REAST</p></li><li><p>TRACE</p></li><li><p>CRATE</p></li><li><p>SLATE</p></li></ul><p>Other good picks might be ARISE or ROUND. Words like ADIEU and AUDIO get more vowels in play, but you could argue that it&rsquo;s better to start with an emphasis on consonants, using a starter like RENTS or CLAMP. Choose your strategy, and see how it plays out.</p><h2>How to win at Wordle</h2><p>We have a few guides to Wordle strategy, which you might like to read over if you&rsquo;re a serious student of the game. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-win-at-wordle-according-to-my-wife-1848480285\" target=\"_blank\"><u>This one</u></a> covers how to use consonants to your advantage, while <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-master-or-cheat-at-wordle-the-internets-favor-1848312354\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this one</u></a> focuses on a strategy that uses the most common letters. In <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-try-quordle-if-youre-too-good-at-wordle-1848540319\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this advanced guide</u></a>, we detail a three-pronged approach for fishing for hints while maximizing your chances of winning quickly.</p><p>The biggest thing that separates Wordle winners from Wordle losers is that winners <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-lost-wordle-today-1850348061\" target=\"_blank\"><u>use their guesses to gather information about what letters are in the word</u></a>. If you know that the word must end in -OUND, don&rsquo;t waste four guesses on MOUND, ROUND, SOUND, and HOUND; combine those consonants and guess MARSH.

					"thumbnail": "",
					"encoded": {
						"__cdata": "<p>Apple made a splash during <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-apple-announced-at-wwdc-2024\" target=\"_blank\">June's WWDC keynote</a> when it announced <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-bringing-ai-to-iphone-ipad-mac-wwdc\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Intelligence</a>. It's the company's official foray into the trendy AI features most tech companies have adopted already. While Apple Intelligence might have generated the most headlines over the past week, many of its main features will not be present when you update your iPhone, iPad, or Mac this fall.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-16/how-the-us-mopped-up-a-third-of-global-capital-flows-since-covid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is staggering the rollout of these highly-anticipated AI features. A key reason is, simply, that these features just aren't ready yet. Apple has been scrambling for over a year to implement generative AI features in its products, after the tech exploded in late 2022. (Thanks, ChatGPT.) Many of these features are quite involved, and will take more time to get right. </p><p>That said, Apple probably could release these features sooner and in larger batches if it wanted to, but there's a strategy here: By rolling out big AI features in limited numbers, Apple can root out any major issues before adding more AI to the mix (<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-tell-when-an-artificial-intelligence-is-hallucin-1850280001\" target=\"_blank\">AI hallucinates</a>, after all), and can continue to build up its cloud network without putting too much pressure on the system. It helps that the company is keeping these features to a specific, small pool of Apple devices: iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max (and likely the iPhone 16 line), as well as M-Series Macs and iPads.  </p><h2>Apple Intelligence in 2024</h2><p>If you install the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/install-ios-18-beta-wwdc\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 18</a> or macOS 15 betas right now, you might think no Apple Intelligence features are going to be ready in the fall. That's because Apple is delaying these AI features for beta testers until sometime later this summer. The public beta is still scheduled to drop during July, so it seems like a safe assumption that Apple is planning on beta testing Apple Intelligence soon, but we don't know for sure. </p><p>There are some AI features currently in this first beta, even if they aren't strictly \"Apple Intelligence\" features: iOS 18 supports <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-generate-live-transcriptions-in-ios-18\" target=\"_blank\">transcriptions for voice memos</a> as well as enhanced voicemail transcriptions, and supports automatically <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/every-new-apple-notes-app-feature-in-ios-18\" target=\"_blank\">calculating equations you type out</a>. It's a limited experience, but seeing as it's only the first beta, we'll see more features soon. </p><p>In fact, Apple currently plans to roll out some flagship features with the first release of Apple Intelligence. That includes summaries for webpages, voice memos, notes, and emails; AI writing tools (such as rewriting and proofreading); and image generation, including the AI-generated emojis Apple is branding \"Genmoji.\" You'll also receive AI summaries of notifications and see certain alerts first based on what the AI thinks is most important. </p><p>In addition, some of Siri's new updates will be out with iOS 18's initial release. This fall, you should notice the assistant's new UI, as well as the convenient new option for typing to Siri. But most of Siri's advertised features won't be ready for a while. (More on that below.)</p><p>The timeline for ChatGPT integration is also a bit up in the air: It may not arrive with the first release of iOS 18 in the fall, but Gurman believes it'll be here before the end of the year. For developers, Xcode's AI assistant, Swift Assist, is likely not out until later this year. </p><h2>Apple Intelligence's new Siri won't be here until spring of 2025</h2><p>The largest delay appears to be to Siri's standout upgrades, many of which won't hit iOS and macOS until <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-08/microsoft-orders-china-staff-to-switch-from-android-phones-to-iphones-for-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">spring of 2025</a>, with a beta set for January. These upgrades include contextual understanding and actions: The big example from the WWDC keynote was when a demonstrator asked Siri when her mom's flight would be getting in, and the digital assistant was able to answer the question by pulling data from multiple apps. This \"understanding,\" which would power many convenient actions without needing to explicitly tell Siri what you want it to do, needs more time to bake. </p><p>In addition, Apple is taking until next year for Siri's ability to act within apps from user commands. When available, you'll be able to ask Siri to edit a photo then add it to a message before sending it off. Siri will actually feel like a smart assistant that can do things on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac for you, but that takes time. </p><p>Siri also won't be able to analyze and understand what's happening on your screen until 2025. Next year, you should be able to ask Siri a simple question based on what you're doing on your device, and the assistant should understand. If you're trying to make movie plans with someone to see <em>Inside Out 2</em>, you could ask Siri \"when is it playing?\" and Siri should analyze the conversation and return results for movie times in your area. </p><p>Finally, Apple Intelligence remains English-only until at least next year. Apple needs more time to train the AI on other languages. As with other AI features, however, this is one that makes a lot of sense to delay until it's 100% ready. </p><p>AI might be the focus of the tech industry, but big AI features often roll out to disastrous ends. (Just look at <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/googles-ai-still-recommending-glue-pizza\" target=\"_blank\">Google's AI Overviews</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/microsoft-pulling-recall-from-copilot-at-launch\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft's Recall feature</a>.) The more time Apple gives itself to get the tech right, the better. In the meantime, we can use the new features that are already available.  </p>"

						"__cdata": "<p>A few weeks back, the air conditioning in my 12-year-old Kia Soul started acting up. Sometimes it worked great. Other times, the blower wouldn't turn on at all. There was no discernible pattern&mdash;it would work right away or not at all, or suddenly turn on while I was driving.  (Unsurprisingly, this started happening right around the time New York City began getting hit with heat advisories.)</p><p>Last week, I thought I was finally cooked (figuratively, but also literally): The AC worked on Tuesday, then it never worked again. After four sweltering days and a few long sweaty holiday weekend drives, I took it to a mechanic, who checked various fuses and relays and determined I needed a new blower motor, which would cost more than $1,000, most of that for labor. (Apparently a Kia Soul is built weird and is hard to repair.) </p><p>So I went home and did what I should have done in the first place: I began frantically researching the problem to see if others were in the same boat. And it turned out <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.kiasoulforums.com%2F+blower+motor+not+working&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.kiasoulforums.com%2F+blower+motor+not+working&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg60gEJMTI2NThqMWo5qAIAsAIB&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">a ton of folks have a problem with intermittent AC functionality</a>&mdash;not just with the Kia Soul, but with <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CarRepair/comments/o06o9d/got_to_smack_under_passenger_side_dash_to_get/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">different makes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/5je424/i_need_to_smack_my_dashboard_with_a_mallet_for/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">models</a>. And the same advice kept popping up again and again: Try giving the front center console a real good kick.<br><br>You'd think we've moved beyond the era where devices were simple enough that hitting them would make them start working, but I had nothing to lose except the cost of a $1,000 repair, so I tried it. (Well, technically I thumped it hard with my fist; I was stopped at a red light and couldn't get good leverage for a kick.) Instantly, the blower motor switched on and a blast of cold air filled the car.</p><p>The lesson here is twofold: 1) when in doubt, consult the internet for advice before shelling out big bucks for a repair, and 2) sometimes a kick, smack, or thump really will fix the problem.</p><h2>Turn to the collected wisdom of the internet</h2><p>I'm not suggesting the mechanic who told me I needed a new blower motor was trying to rip me off. Assuming he actually checked all the electrical issues he claimed to have checked, \"motor bad\" seems a logical conclusion. But being the kind of person who drives a 12-year-old car (a cheapskate), I wanted to more thoroughly exhaust my options before spending a bunch of money on someone's best guess. Because even accounting for experience and expertise, some mechanics, when faced with a problem that might take hours to properly diagnose, <a href=\"http://jimroal.com/repair.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">will just rely on intuition</a>. And sure, maybe their fix will work&mdash;but that doesn't mean it was the cheapest option, or even necessary.</p><p>In this case, my research turned up many other Kia owners who'd experienced similar AC issues: The air would blow cold, but only sometimes. Our symptoms didn't match up with descriptions of a failing blower motor, which usually involve <a href=\"https://www.dubizzle.com/blog/cars/bad-blower-motor-signs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">weird noises, smells, and gradually weakening airflow</a>. And lots of these hot and sweaty folks noted that giving their car a really good smack would solve the problem. It turned out the collective wisdom of a bunch of frustrated folks turned out to be more useful than the opinion of a single mechanic who didn't have all day to research my issue and find the solution that would make him the least amount of money.</p><p>Typically in these situations, I'm looking for advice from a mix of experts and laypeople, and the internet is full of both. Here are some good tactics to try to find what you're looking for:</p><ul><li><p>Google your problem + Reddit, which will guide you to any established communities where people are discussing the kinds of problems you're facing. </p></li><li><p>Look for forums aimed specifically at owners of whatever it is that's giving you a headache. In my case, that was <a href=\"https://www.kiasoulforums.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Kia Soul Forums</a>.</p></li><li><p>Google your problem +YouTube for (possibly) helpful repair videos&mdash;though finding one that will actually be helpful can be a challenge.</p></li></ul><p>Like turning to WebMD every time your stomach hurts can convince you you're dying when you just ate a bad taco, the repair suggestions you get on the internet won't always be the right ones&mdash;but if they're simple enough to try yourself (hitting something; replacing a cheap part), you might as well. At worst, you can take your research to a certified repair person to help them more capably diagnose the issue.</p><p>Also: Unless your repair need is dire, a second opinion, or at least a brief cooling-off period&mdash;no pun intended&mdash;is never a bad idea. (For what it's worth, a second mechanic quoted me $300 for the same repair, but I'm glad to have avoided spending even that much for now.)</p><h2>Why hitting it made my car's AC work</h2><p>So why did a thump to the center console fix my AC? I don't know&mdash;and no one on the internet really knows either. Those who suggested it were either working off the advice of others (one said a Kia technician at his dealership told him to try it) or are apparently just well-versed in <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/can-you-actually-fix-your-tech-by-smacking-it-1848983083\" target=\"_blank\">the tried-and-true method of hitting your tech until it starts working</a>. </p><p>Possible causes posited included a <a href=\"https://www.kiasoulforums.com/posts/1336585/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">loose wire</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.kiasoulforums.com/posts/1282529/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">melted or otherwise faulty connection</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.kiasoulforums.com/posts/644938/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">grounding issue</a>, and, yes, a <a href=\"https://www.kiasoulforums.com/threads/ac-blower-motor-problem-solution.122738\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">failing blower motor</a>, all of which can be temporarily remedied with a little percussion. Short of a more in-depth diagnostic, though, it's hard to say. Many of these forum threads do provide suggestions for how to look deeper into the issue. Maybe I'll do that someday&mdash;when just hitting it stops working. </p>"

Not only does this look nice, but it makes everything fit together better, since similarly sized vessels can be stacked or sat next to each other with ease. </p><p>Consider a set like this, which has 24 identical bottles, plus labels, so all your spices and herbs look more uniform. </p><div class=\"mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6\">\n    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/yL4G6?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Roundups&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=whole-shop-card&amp;element_label=AOZITA%2024%20Pcs%20Glass%20Spice%20Jars%20with%20Labels&amp;short_url=yL4G6&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" data-commerce=\"1\" target=\"_blank\" data-parent-group=\"affiliate-link\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\" class=\"cursor-default no-underline\" data-ga-click=\"data-ga-click\" data-ga-item=\"whole-shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"AOZITA 24 Pcs Glass Spice Jars with Labels\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap justify-between px-7 text-black no-underline md:flex-nowrap md:px-8\">\n            <div class=\"order-1 mx-auto flex flex-col justify-center md:order-2 md:ml-4 md:w-full md:grow\">\n                <div class=\"block cursor-pointer text-center font-akshar text-2xl font-medium leading-7 text-brand-green duration-200 ease-in-out hover:text-brand-green-700 md:text-left md:text-xl md:leading-6\">AOZITA 24 Pcs Glass Spice Jars with Labels\n                </div>\n                                <div class=\"mt-4 hidden md:flex md:justify-between\">\n                                            <div class=\"self-end\">\n                            <div class=\"mb-0 h-11 md:flex md:flex-col md:justify-center\"><div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $19.99\n                            <span class=\"font-medium\">at Amazon</span>\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"w-44 self-end\">\n                            <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Shop Now\n</button>\n                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 mt-5 h-auto w-full md:order-1 md:mt-0 md:hidden\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J29PY3RFA9XHW7BG812FKYMK/images-1.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720460447.jpg\" alt=\"AOZITA 24 Pcs Glass Spice Jars with Labels\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 ml-2 hidden w-32 shrink-0 items-center md:order-1 md:ml-0 md:flex\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J29PY3RFA9XHW7BG812FKYMK/images-1.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720460447.jpg\" alt=\"AOZITA 24 Pcs Glass Spice Jars with Labels\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-3 flex grow flex-wrap md:hidden md:grow-0\">\n                                    <div class=\"mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Shop Now\n</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"mx-2 mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $19.99\n                            <span class=\"font-medium\">at Amazon</span>\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n</a></div>\n<h2>Next, your spices need to be accessible</h2><p>Whether you decant them and put them into more uniform containers or not, your spices need to be accessible and easy to manage.

When your counters are already full while you prep for dinner, it's a compounding nightmare. </p><p>First, consider a pull-out rack that can help you avoid that altogether. You just yank the rack along its track and it pops right out of the cupboard, giving you easy access to every jar, even the ones in the back. </p><div class=\"mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6\">\n    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/xP6eO?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Roundups&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=whole-shop-card&amp;element_label=2%20Packs%20Pull%20Out%20Spice%20Rack%20Organizer%20for%20Cabinet&amp;short_url=xP6eO&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" data-commerce=\"1\" target=\"_blank\" data-parent-group=\"affiliate-link\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\" class=\"cursor-default no-underline\" data-ga-click=\"data-ga-click\" data-ga-item=\"whole-shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"2 Packs Pull Out Spice Rack Organizer for Cabinet\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap justify-between px-7 text-black no-underline md:flex-nowrap md:px-8\">\n            <div class=\"order-1 mx-auto flex flex-col justify-center md:order-2 md:ml-4 md:w-full md:grow\">\n                <div class=\"block cursor-pointer text-center font-akshar text-2xl font-medium leading-7 text-brand-green duration-200 ease-in-out hover:text-brand-green-700 md:text-left md:text-xl md:leading-6\">2 Packs Pull Out Spice Rack Organizer for Cabinet\n                </div>\n                                <div class=\"mt-4 hidden md:flex md:justify-between\">\n                                            <div class=\"self-end\">\n                            <div class=\"mb-0 h-11 md:flex md:flex-col md:justify-center\"><div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $21.24\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"flex items-center justify-center gap-x-1 font-bold md:justify-start\">\n            <span class=\"text-sm line-through\">$24.99</span>\n            <span class=\"text-sm text-brand-green\">Save $3.75</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"w-44 self-end\">\n                            <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Get Deal\n</button>\n                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 mt-5 h-auto w-full md:order-1 md:mt-0 md:hidden\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J29PY3RFA9XHW7BG812FKYMK/images-2.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720460447.jpg\" alt=\"2 Packs Pull Out Spice Rack Organizer for Cabinet\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 ml-2 hidden w-32 shrink-0 items-center md:order-1 md:ml-0 md:flex\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J29PY3RFA9XHW7BG812FKYMK/images-2.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720460447.jpg\" alt=\"2 Packs Pull Out Spice Rack Organizer for Cabinet\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-3 flex grow flex-wrap md:hidden md:grow-0\">\n                                    <div class=\"mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Get Deal\n</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"mx-2 mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $21.24\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"flex items-center justify-center gap-x-1 font-bold md:justify-start\">\n            <span class=\"text-sm line-through\">$24.99</span>\n            <span class=\"text-sm text-brand-green\">Save $3.75</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n</a></div>\n<p>Depending on your preferences, you may want to get a tiered organizer that will lift the ones in the back up above the ones in the front.

It's an adjustable, expandable shelving unit that fits into your cabinet once you remove the existing shelves, creating space for every size of jar around the perimeter of the unit and leaving space in the middle. With this, you can see every single jar and bottle at all times, plus still have room in the center for larger bottles. </p><div class=\"mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6\">\n    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/BdK8B?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Roundups&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=whole-shop-card&amp;element_label=Spicy%20Shelf%20Spice%20Rack%20Organizer%20for%20Cabinet%20-%20Expandable%20Spice%20Rack%20and%20Stackable%20Cabinet%20%26%20Pantry%20Organizer&amp;short_url=BdK8B&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" data-commerce=\"1\" target=\"_blank\" data-parent-group=\"affiliate-link\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\" class=\"cursor-default no-underline\" data-ga-click=\"data-ga-click\" data-ga-item=\"whole-shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Spicy Shelf Spice Rack Organizer for Cabinet - Expandable Spice Rack and Stackable Cabinet &amp;

Adding to this litany is DWZ: the \"Die With Zero\" movement. The Die With Zero movement is a financial philosophy that challenges traditional ideas about saving and retirement. Unlike the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, which <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-basics-of-fire-financial-independence-and-early-re-1839417389\" target=\"_blank\">emphasizes aggressive saving</a>, DWZ encourages people to spend their money more freely throughout their lives. By living this way, you strive to spend the money you have, rather than live for a future that isn't guaranteed; you use up the assets you have now and die with \"zero.\" This approach aims to balance financial security with living life to the fullest, advocating for strategic spending rather than excessive saving.</p><h2>Core principles of \"Die With Zero\"</h2><p>Here are the main philosophies driving DWZ believers.</p><p>1. <strong>Maximize life experiences</strong>: The DWZ movement emphasizes spending money on meaningful experiences while you're young and healthy enough to enjoy them. This could mean traveling, pursuing hobbies, or investing in personal growth. The idea is that these experiences often provide more value and happiness than material possessions or a large bank account later in life.</p><p>2.<strong> Balance saving and spending</strong>: While the movement doesn't advocate reckless spending, it encourages finding a middle ground between saving for the future and enjoying the present. This means saving enough to meet future needs and maintain financial security, but not hoarding wealth unnecessarily at the expense of current experiences and opportunities.</p><p>3. <strong>Use your money as a tool</strong>: DWZ proponents view money as a means to enhance life, not as an end goal in itself. This principle encourages people to think critically about how their money can best serve their happiness and fulfillment, rather than simply accumulating wealth for its own sake.</p><p>4. <strong>Die with (close to) zero</strong>: The ultimate goal of the DWZ movement is to use up most of your assets by the end of your life, leaving minimal inheritance. This doesn't mean dying penniless, but rather timing your spending and experiences so that you've used most of your resources by the end of your life, having maximized their utility.</p><h2>Key differences from FIRE</h2><p>While both FIRE and DWZ are alternative financial philosophies, they differ significantly in their approaches. FIRE focuses on early retirement through extreme saving and frugality, often with the goal of quitting traditional work as soon as possible. In contrast, DWZ emphasizes enjoying life now and throughout one's lifetime, rather than deferring happiness to a future retirement date.</p><p>Additionally, DWZ encourages strategic spending throughout life, not just in <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/five-things-to-do-a-year-before-you-retire\" target=\"_blank\">retirement</a>. This means potentially working longer but living a more balanced and enjoyable life along the way, rather than sacrificing current experiences for a future payoff.</p><h2>Is Die With Zero right for you?</h2><p>The DWZ movement is particularly popular among <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/what-is-a-dink-or-a-henry\" target=\"_blank\">DINKs (Dual Income, No Kids)</a> and others who have more financial flexibility and fewer dependents. It appeals to those who prioritize experiences over leaving large inheritances, and to individuals who want to make the most of their money while they're still young and healthy enough to fully enjoy it.</p><p>Consider embracing the DWZ philosophy if you value experiences over material possessions and find more fulfillment in creating memories than in accumulating wealth. It may also be a good fit if you don't prioritize <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-handle-an-unexpected-financial-windfall-1846001701\" target=\"_blank\">leaving an inheritance</a>, as the movement encourages using most of your assets during your lifetime. Additionally, if you're comfortable with some financial risk and trust in your ability to manage money effectively over time, DWZ could align well with your outlook.</p><p>Of course, proceed with caution if you have dependents who rely on your financial support, as the DWZ approach may not provide the long-term security they need. Similarly, if you have a strong desire to leave a financial legacy or support causes after your death, this philosophy may not align with your goals. Lastly, if you're risk-averse or particularly worried about unexpected expenses in the future, the reduced safety net inherent in the DWZ approach might cause more stress than it's worth.</p><p>The Die With Zero movement offers a fresh perspective on personal finance, encouraging people to live life to the fullest while maintaining financial responsibility. As with any financial philosophy, it's essential to consider your personal circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance before fully embracing this approach. It may be beneficial to consult with a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/heres-when-its-time-to-call-a-financial-advisor-1850053476\" target=\"_blank\">financial advisor</a> to determine how elements of DWZ might be incorporated into your financial strategy in a way that aligns with your unique situation and aspirations.</p>"

not a regular wide curved gaming monitor. It's for serious gamers with powerful computers. It has impressive specs, but you'll need a top-notch gaming computer with specific outputs to take full advantage of its 240Hz refresh rate potential. </p><p>This monitor came out in 2023 with an <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">\"excellent\" review from PCMag</a>, mainly due to its impressive 7,680 by 2,160 4K native resolution, the ridiculous 57-inch screen size, its great color range and accuracy, the 240Hz refresh rate, and its design. The VA panel also means you get a bright 1,000-nit screen.</p><p>To make full use of its powerful 240Hz refresh rate, you'll need to use a DisplayPort 2.1, or you'll be limited to 120Hz. You'll also need a powerful modern graphics card that is able to push the frames at a native resolution to max out the monitor's frame rates. </p><p>Although it is pricey, this monitor is a great value for the money of the right gamer. You'll need plenty of space to fit a 57-inch screen, as well as a powerful computer to justify using the monitor&mdash;if you're not a competitive gamer with a powerful computer, it's probably not worth the price tag.</p>"

Car insurance <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/how-much-is-car-insurance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">averages $1,718 annually</a> for full coverage, health insurance can cost <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/how-much-does-health-insurance-cost-4774184\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">more than $1,000 a month</a> depending on your age and circumstances, and home insurance averages <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/average-homeowners-insurance-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">about $2,000</a> a year. Protecting what you have, from your possessions to your health, just keeps getting more and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/six-ways-to-help-lower-your-home-insurance-premium-1850484971\" target=\"_blank\">more expensive</a>&mdash;and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/seven-types-of-insurance-that-are-usually-a-waste-of-mo-1850532298\" target=\"_blank\">not all insurance is worth having</a>.</p><p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean insurance is a scam&mdash;no matter how high those premiums might seem, when a claim gets paid it can save you from financial disaster. The flood insurance on my house is pretty expensive, but when the floods came a few years ago the insurance settlement saved our butts and enabled us to rebuild and replace, for example. But sometimes it makes more sense to self-insure than pay for a policy.</p><h2>Self-insurance</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/selfinsurance.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Self-insurance</a> is a simple concept:  Instead of buying a policy from an insurer, you safeguard against future problems by setting aside money on your own to cover the associated costs. For example, if you&rsquo;ve paid off your mortgage and don&rsquo;t want to pay homeowners insurance premiums anymore, you could put sufficient funds aside to cover the potential costs of repairing or replacing your home after future disaster.</p><p>You&rsquo;re already self-insuring stuff without realizing it&mdash;everything you own that isn&rsquo;t covered by an insurance policy is essentially self-insured. If you bought an expensive television yesterday and it&rsquo;s not covered by an explicit insurance policy, if it gets stolen tomorrow you&rsquo;ll have to pay for its replacement from your own pocket. That&rsquo;s self-insurance. You can self-insure anything to a lesser or greater extent. If you don&rsquo;t have health insurance, you&rsquo;re self-insuring yourself. If you&rsquo;re required to carry liability insurance on your vehicle but opt not to pay for collision or theft insurance, you&rsquo;re self-insuring those aspects of your car.</p><p>The main benefit of self-insurance is that you can keep the money you would normally spend on premiums and let it accumulate, preferably in an interest-earning account somewhere. If a problem arises, you <a href=\"https://www.thebalancemoney.com/avoiding-high-insurance-costs-by-self-insuring-2645677\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">have the money to deal with it</a>. If you never experience a problem, that money is still yours, as opposed to insurance premiums for a policy that never paid out.</p><h2>When to self-insure</h2><p>Self-insurance is tempting because in theory you keep your money but also have a plan in place to handle unexpected problems. But unless you have significant liquid funds to draw on, it&rsquo;s only a good idea in some specific scenarios. For example, let&rsquo;s say your flood insurance premiums cost $1,000 a year. You drop your policy and put the money into investments instead, where you get a 10% average return, and after 10 years you have <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/retirement/2021/12/15/how-much-difference-can-saving-1000-extra-make/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">about $16,000</a>. That&rsquo;s great! The bad news is that the average claim paid by the National Flood Insurance Program is <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/everyone-needs-flood-insurance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">more than $66,000</a>, meaning you might be $50,000 short if your house floods. Paying the annual premium is a much better deal in this scenario unless you never need to make a claim&mdash;which is a bit of a gamble.</p><p>That means there are two basic scenarios where self-insuring makes sense: when the cost of replacement or paying for services is within your means (e.g., you have $66,000 sitting around earning interest somewhere you can set aside for flood damage), or when the item you&rsquo;re insuring isn&rsquo;t worth much, making the cost of insurance a bad bet.</p><p>There are some specific scenarios where you should definitely consider self-insuring:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Car insurance.</strong> Most states require you to carry liability insurance, but more comprehensive coverage is usually up to you. If your car is old and isn&rsquo;t worth much, and/or you have the ability to do repairs yourself, opting to self-insure the vehicle can make sense.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jewelry.</strong> Like a car, most jewelry <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/11-things-that-lose-value-as-soon-as-you-buy-them-1849036728\" target=\"_blank\">plummets in value</a> the moment you buy it, which makes insuring the stuff a bad deal in most cases. Most homeowners insurance covers jewelry to a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/how-to-insure-jewelry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">very limited amount</a>&mdash;about $1,500 to $2,000&mdash;so if your jewelry isn&rsquo;t worth much more than that, it makes sense to just self-insure it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Life insurance.</strong> The sole purpose of life insurance is to <a href=\"https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/self-insurance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">ensure your family isn&rsquo;t left penniless</a> if you die unexpectedly. If you have accumulated significant assets that provide an income without a salary, or your family simply won&rsquo;t need your income (because your children are grown and your spouse has access to shared retirement savings, for example), then life insurance is probably an <a href=\"https://www.policygenius.com/life-insurance/life-insurance-vs-self-insurance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">unnecessary expense</a> and self-insuring is a better idea.</p></li></ul><p>One thing to consider in these scenarios is that the &ldquo;significant assets&rdquo; part where you can cover unexpected losses without insurance need to be <em>liquid</em> assets. If your net worth is tied up in property or businesses, for example, self-insuring might require you to sell off those assets, which might not be a pleasant experience. But if you have those liquid assets and you know you can cover the expenses that come with negative events, self-insurance can be a viable option that can save you a lot of money over time.</p>"

					"description": "You don't have to choose one over the other, but these lending products have certain pros and cons.",
					"thumbnail": "",
					"encoded": {
						"__cdata": "<p>If you're shopping for revolving credit, you've got a couple of different options. While both lines of credit and credit cards offer flexible borrowing options, they have distinct pros and cons that set them apart. It's a classic \"square versus rectangle\" situation: All credit cards are lines of credit, but not all lines of credit are credit cards. So while a credit card is connected to (and allows you to access) a line of credit, it&rsquo;s possible to open a line of credit that doesn&rsquo;t have a credit card associated with it. Here's what you need to know about some important differences between a line of credit and a credit card. </p><h2>Access to funds</h2><p>A line of credit allows you to borrow money up to a predetermined limit as needed. You can draw from this credit line at your discretion, often by transferring funds directly to your bank account. Credit cards, on the other hand, provide a revolving credit line primarily for making purchases and, in some cases, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/what-is-cash-advance-on-credit-card\" target=\"_blank\">obtaining cash advances</a>.</p><h2>Interest rates</h2><p>Interest rates typically favor lines of credit, which usually offer <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-lower-your-credit-card-interest-rate\" target=\"_blank\">lower rates compared to credit cards</a>. These rates are often variable, meaning they can fluctuate based on market conditions. Credit cards, in contrast, generally carry higher interest rates, which can be either fixed or variable depending on the card issuer and terms.</p><h2>Repayment terms</h2><p>A line of credit often requires minimum monthly payments, with interest charged only on the amount you've actually borrowed. This can make it a more cost-effective option for larger, long-term expenses. Credit cards require minimum monthly payments as well, but interest is charged on any unpaid balances, which can accumulate quickly if not managed carefully.</p><h2>Fund withdrawal</h2><p>With a line of credit, you can usually transfer funds directly to your bank account, giving you more flexibility in how you use the money. Credit cards are primarily designed for making purchases directly, although they do offer cash advances at typically higher interest rates&mdash;<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/what-is-cash-advance-on-credit-card\" target=\"_blank\">not a move I would recommend</a>.</p><h2>Fee structures</h2><p>Lines of credit may have annual fees and withdrawal fees, depending on the lender and the specific terms of the agreement. Credit cards often come with annual fees, balance transfer fees, and higher cash advance fees, in addition to potential penalties for late payments or exceeding your credit limit.</p><h2>Impact on credit score</h2><p>Lines of credit may have less impact on your credit utilization ratio, which is an important factor in <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-its-never-been-more-important-to-have-a-good-credit-1850857840\" target=\"_blank\">credit scoring</a>. Credit cards, however, can significantly affect this ratio, potentially having a larger impact on your credit scores depending on how you use and manage the card. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/all-the-ways-you-didn-t-know-you-could-raise-your-credi-1850192800\" target=\"_blank\">Here are some more ways to give your credit score a boost</a>.</p><h2>Best uses</h2><p>Lines of credit are typically ideal for financing <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/six-ways-to-handle-unexpected-expenses\" target=\"_blank\">large expenses</a>, home improvements, or serving as emergency funds. Their lower interest rates and flexible withdrawal options make them well-suited for these purposes. Plus, a personal line of credit gives you more flexibility than a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/should-you-get-a-personal-loan-or-use-a-credit-card-1845725948\" target=\"_blank\">one-time personal loan</a>. Credit cards are better suited for everyday purchases, building credit history through regular use and timely payments, and earning rewards such as <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/pay-attention-to-your-cash-back-rewards-bonus-categorie-1849965980\" target=\"_blank\">cash back</a> or <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-longest-you-should-hoard-your-travel-points-1850374283\" target=\"_blank\">travel points</a>. </p><h2>What this means for you</h2><p>When deciding between a line of credit and a credit card, consider your financial needs and habits. If you're planning a large expense or want a financial safety net, a line of credit might be the better choice. Its lower interest rates and flexible withdrawals can save you money in the long run. But for most people's everyday spending, building credit, and earning rewards, a credit card is the more suitable option. It's also simply the more widely accepted option for regular purchases.</p><p>Your credit score may benefit more from responsible use of a credit card, but a line of credit could be less risky if you're concerned about overspending. Consider your ability to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-pay-off-credit-card-debt\" target=\"_blank\">manage credit responsibly</a>. We all know how credit cards can lead to high-interest debt if not paid off monthly: If you're feeling cautious, lines of credit might offer more breathing room with potentially lower rates. And remember, it's not as if you're limited to choosing just one. Many people find value in having both a line of credit and a credit card, using each for its strengths to create a comprehensive approach to personal finance. </p>"

I don&rsquo;t think about it a lot when I&rsquo;m purchasing a pan, but I often need to improvise a lid. Usually it&rsquo;s for a grilled cheese, or panini-style sandwich I&rsquo;m trying to heat through. Frying pans are designed to let steam escape and encourage air flow, so the bottom is the only point of heating. That&rsquo;s great for searing, and toasting the exterior bread of my cubano, but the cheese in the center will never heat through before the bread burns. That&rsquo;s where the lid comes in.&nbsp;</p><p>Putting a lid, or an upside-down bowl in this case, on the pan traps steam and allows the heat to build around the food in the pan so you can melt that cheese in the center. The same method is used for flash-steaming frozen gyoza to help heat the filling in the center. After a few minutes, you take the lid off, let the steam go, and crisp up the bottom.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6\">\n    <a href=\"https://cc.lifehacker.com/v1/otc/06ZVRiLmglGs4QA6plTXzTC?merchant=05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCOOK-COLOR-Stainless-Steel-Mixing%2Fdp%2FB0C7DB2PBQ%2Fref%3Dasc_df_B0C7DB2PBQ%2F&amp;template=Hacks&amp;module=shop-card&amp;element=offer&amp;item=whole-shop-card&amp;position=&amp;element_label=Stainless+Steel+Mixing+Bowl+Set+-+6+pieces&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss&amp;product_uuid=07HotVyzLCYEqKYx1bUFXPI&amp;offer_uuid=02HpWtQX3MEcAUKEpKSejnk&amp;object_type=02HpWtQX3MEcAUKEpKSejnk&amp;object_uuid=07HotVyzLCYEqKYx1bUFXPI\" data-commerce=\"1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" data-parent-group=\"affiliate-link\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\" class=\"cursor-default no-underline\" data-ga-click=\"data-ga-click\" data-ga-item=\"whole-shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Stainless Steel Mixing Bowl Set -

The reason mixing bowls function well as lids, especially a nesting set, is because most circular items in your kitchen (bowls, pans, pots, cake pans) reflect each other in diameter. Usually by inch integers&mdash;six, eight, 10, 11, and 12 are the most common. If you have a set of four or six mixing bowls, the odds are pretty good you&rsquo;ve got a bowl that matches up with your frying pan.&nbsp;</p><p>Using a metal mixing bowl as a lid is easy. Grab a bowl, flip it upside-down and carefully place it over the pan so the lip of the bowl rests on the top edge of the pan. The shape of the bowl keeps it clear of the pan&rsquo;s angled handle, as opposed to an oversized plate that would bump into it. If the lid slides off to one side, you probably need to use a size down. If the lid falls <em>into</em> the pan, then you need one size up. If you don&rsquo;t have a good match then you could technically use the too-small bowl as a &ldquo;tight fitting&rdquo; lid, or the too-big bowl as a loose lid (steam will escape out the open edge).&nbsp;</p><h2>Exercise caution</h2><p>Make sure you&rsquo;re using a metal mixing bowl, not glass. Besides being a heck of a lot lighter, regular glass bowls and even heat-resistant glasses can break due to thermal shock, and that is a harrowing experience (I wish it upon mostly no one).&nbsp;</p><p>Be careful taking the metal bowl off the pan. Not only is the bowl in direct contact with the pan&rsquo;s 300+&deg;F hot edge, but the bowl&rsquo;s dome will be filled with 212&deg;F steam. Use oven mitts to protect your fingers and use two hands to take the hot bowl off.&nbsp;</p><p>There are quitters out there who'll go buy a set of lids, but why unnecessarily dig into your budget and take up extra space in your kitchen cupboard? Personally, I think the versatility alone is worth it. I'll ask this: Can you mix cookie dough or marinate steaks in a regular, flat pan lid? I rest my case.&nbsp;</p>"

						"__cdata": "<p>On Friday afternoon, my bosses asked if I'd like to test out and explain <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/noplace-make-new-friends/id6478601246\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Noplace</a>, a new social media platform that shot to the top of the Apple Store charts when it switched from referral-only to free-for-all. When they asked me to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-is-the-new-social-media-app-bereal-and-do-you-r-1848780094\" target=\"_blank\">do that with BeReal two years ago</a>, I ended up falling in love with the app and using it with my friends all summer long, so I was excited. Maybe Noplace, billed as \"MySpace for Gen Z,\" would turn out the same&mdash;a fun platform for my friends and me to play with for the rest of the warm months. I downloaded it, impressed by its commitment to the customizable themes and colors that defined my social media use when I was a kid coding pet pages on Neopets and learning HTML so my LiveJournal could reflect on the outside how I felt on the inside. Here's what I found. </p><h2>What is Noplace?</h2><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/noplace-make-new-friends/id6478601246\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Noplace</a> is bright and colorful, promising to connect people with similar interests. You get a profile page, which you're able to customize by changing the colors and even the bezels around the text boxes. Like old-timey Facebook, there's a \"wall\" where your friends can post public messages to you. Like LiveJournal, there are sections built into your profile where you can announce what you're eating, listening to, or doing. Like MySpace, you can publicly rank your top friends. Like any other platform, there is a direct-messaging component. And like X, there's a tab where you can post what you're thinking or feeling and strangers can respond. </p><p>I messed around on the app for three days, but never quite figured out how it connects people with similar interests. On Noplace, your interests are called \"stars,\" so I selected a few stars from the categories it offered up: Fortnite under \"video games,\" for instance. I noticed a lot of the possible stars were vague&mdash;\"astrology,\" \"LGBTQ,\" \"reading\"&mdash;so I created my own in the search bar. I went with baseball and the Minnesota Twins, then added spin class, too. But there was never a way to find other people who chose those stars or connect with them. They just appeared on my profile. It was a little sad, but I'm not ruling out the possibility that I just couldn't figure it out. </p><h2>How does Noplace work?</h2><p>I started posting on the public, feed-style forum right away after quickly throwing together a profile that was all purple, featured a picture of me, and alerted any potential new friends to the fact that I was listening to \"Whenever, Wherever\" by Shakira while eating a package of dried seaweed snacks. It really did feel very 2004. I couldn't believe I used to spend so much time on real-time updates back then, especially considering I was doing it all from a desktop computer, tethered to a giant monitor in my basement in the era before smartphones. </p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J29BYV3B2J078TTKBCAFTMFV/images-1.fill.size_363x750.v1720448937.png\" alt=\"Noplace profile\" width=\"363\" height=\"750\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J29BYV3B2J078TTKBCAFTMFV/images-1.fill.size_800x1651.v1720448937.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J29BYV3B2J078TTKBCAFTMFV/images-1.fill.size_1400x2889.v1720448937.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J29BYV3B2J078TTKBCAFTMFV/images-1.fill.size_2000x4127.v1720448937.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\">My purple profile.</span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Lindsey Ellefson</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>I inquired about how to raise my \"level\" and someone kindly responded to let me know I had to be more interactive on the app to accomplish that. I tapped their profile. They were a young teen. I started tapping more profiles I found in the feed. Everyone appeared to be between 14 and 20. It made me uncomfortable. I felt like an interloper at best and a creep at worst. Not ideal. I decided to force my friends to join, so I could at least be among some peers. That part was easy: I just had to tap an \"invite friends\" button in the search tab, then send them all a text. Further proof that I was way too old to be doing this came when I noticed that even after I imported my contacts, no one from the list appeared to already be on the app. Matters became more dire when two of my best friends who use Android phones told me there was no Android app at all. It was up to me and my iPhone-using pals to infiltrate on our own. </p><p>While I waited for them to set up their profiles and add me back, I commenced shitposting. One teen asked, publicly, if they should watch <em>Yellowjackets</em> and I said \"nah.\" Another posted with a hint of melancholy, saying \"sorry for the inconvenience.\" I told them it was no problem, though I had no idea what they were talking about. The caliber of posts was also really reminiscent of my formative years on Xanga and LiveJournal: There was a lot of complaining about parents, expressing ennui, and self-identifying to the point of ridiculousness. It was all, to be blunt, basic kid stuff, exactly the same as what I was posting 20 years ago. Effort was clearly being taken to create the perfect layout, the most comprehensive and stylish bio, and the edgiest posts. Every once in a while, I'd see someone older post something like, \"Is there anyone my age on here?\" The answer was no. </p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J29BYV3B2J078TTKBCAFTMFV/images-2.fill.size_624x750.v1720448937.png\" alt=\"A forum on Noplace\" width=\"624\" height=\"750\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J29BYV3B2J078TTKBCAFTMFV/images-2.fill.size_800x962.v1720448937.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J29BYV3B2J078TTKBCAFTMFV/images-2.fill.size_1400x1683.v1720448937.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J29BYV3B2J078TTKBCAFTMFV/images-2.fill.size_2000x2404.v1720448937.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\">A forum on Noplace.</span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Lindsey Ellefson</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<h2>Should you join Noplace?</h2><p>I don't think you need to join Noplace if you're an adult&mdash;at least not now. Like Facebook, I assume this will quickly be overrun by cringey adults. We are now the cringey adults. The problem with this app is, at least as it stands, there is no real division between kids and older people. Everyone posts to the same big feed and, as I mentioned, there isn't much of a way to sort and find people with similar interests or demographics. You're posting alongside 14-year-olds while they do the standard 14-year-old stuff of trying to figure out who they are and who they want to portray themselves to be. </p><p>I was able to attain a Level 3 just by posting a bunch, but I got bored pretty quickly. The allure of constantly updating my profile to reveal my relationship status, current snack, and favorite song didn't last long, especially since it felt strange to be broadcasting that information to children. </p><p>It certainly has potential and was fun for a while. Like I said, adults will infiltrate this thing and I'm sure it will become more striated. I can see the appeal of going back to our roots, playing with profile designs and sharing inconsequential updates about unserious matters, but for now, you can't post links or photos. There's nothing mature or constructive to find. There's no way to link with anyone you have anything in common with. Despite the fact everyone is posting together, it feels a little lonely, at least for those of us who lived through the first great era of customization. </p>"

In a recent update, Microsoft has finally added spellcheck and autocorrect to Notepad, the operating system&rsquo;s built-in text app.&nbsp;You'd be forgiven for asking how spellcheck is an exciting new feature in 2024, but it's still good news.</p><p>Notepad has long been one of the go-to text editors on Windows, simply because of its ease of use and functionality&mdash;you can use it to create text without worrying about HTML or other formatting effects. For a long time, Notepad went without significant changes, prompting some Windows users to opt for Notepad2 or Notepad++. That began to change in 2018, when Microsoft added support for Mac and Unix. Since then, the app has slowly improved with the addition of text zoom, wrap-around searches, line numbers, and other features. Now, Microsoft is finally giving Notepad two major additions in the form of spellcheck and autocorrect (both features Apple's TextEdit has offered for a while now.)</p><h2>How to turn on spellcheck in Notepad</h2><p>Spellcheck and autocorrect were previously only available to Windows Insiders, but the upgrade is now finally available to everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Spellcheck in Notepad highlights misspelled words with red squiggly lines, and provide suggestions to help you correct mistakes, but unlike in Word, you'll need to right-click twice to see corrected spelling options.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re worried about these features messing up log and source code files, Microsoft notes the feature will automatically be disabled for those types of files, as these would typically trigger multiple spellcheck errors due to the use of non-standard words.</p><p>Spellcheck and autocorrect are now enabled by default in Windows 11, but you can turn them off in the Notepad Settings. Simply open Notepad, click on the <strong>cog in the top-right corner</strong>, and scroll down until you see toggles for <strong>Spell check</strong> and <strong>Autocorrect</strong>. Click on the drop down menu next to Spell check to toggle the feature on and off for specific file types.</p>"

					"description": "From mildly tense to extremely dark, it's time to Netflix and thrill.",
					"thumbnail": "",
					"encoded": {
						"__cdata": "<p>You&rsquo;d think we all have enough stress in our lives already, but for some reason we still love those heart-pumping thrillers&mdash;whether the quiet, suspenseful kind, or the big action spectacles. It might be that the things that get our hearts racing in real life are in the realm of &ldquo;wow, look at this medical bill,&rdquo; making a spy movie, a heist-gone-wrong scenario, or even a dark kidnapping story a good vehicle for vicarious (and comparatively cheap) thrills. <br><br>Regardless, here are the best thrillers currently streaming on Netflix, with a variety of tones that run from mildly tense to extremely dark.</p><hr><h2><em>Spiderhead</em> (2022)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-BfsNfFoA0J0\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>While Joseph Kosinski&rsquo;s Netflix original <em>Spiderhead</em> didn&rsquo;t make quite the splash of his mega blockbuster, <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, it does make for a smart thriller with sci-fi overtones. Chris Hemsworth plays Steve Abnesti, who oversees a prison program in which prisoners receive less oversight and reduced sentences in exchange for serving as test subjects for a variety of pharmaceuticals. Supposedly, this is the project of some benevolent geniuses who just want to improve humankind, but you might not be surprised to learn (if you&rsquo;ve ever lived in our world) that a pharmaceutical conglomerate has a lot more to do with it. The experiments grow increasingly manipulative and even deadly, with solid performances from Miles Teller and Jurnee Smollett as two of the prison&rsquo;s inmates.</p><hr><h2><em>Fatal Attraction</em> (1987)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-nf8gh_d7Z6k\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>King of the erotic '80s thriller Adrian Lyne directed this prime example of the form, with Michael Douglas as a married Manhattan attorney and Glenn Close as the increasingly unhinged woman who falls for him. It's a thoroughly entertaining soap opera, even if rather terribly dated in its approach to gender roles. More than that, though, it was a <em>massive</em> blockbuster&mdash;and a reminder that there was a time when movies for grown-ups, and dealing with <em>sex</em>, could have mass appeal.</p><hr><h2><em>American Psycho</em> (2000)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-81mibtQWWBg\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>It's another 1980s throwback&mdash;kinda. Writer/director Mary Harron rather brilliantly adapts Bret Easton Ellis' novel with Christian Bale as New York investment banker Patrick Bateman, who moonlights as a serial killer (maybe? Or is it all in his head?). Incredibly stylish and violent, the film wrings every ounce of satire out of its narrative, skewering misogyny, capitalism, and America-style narcissism just as brutally as Patrick does his victims. Entirely unique.</p><hr><h2><em>Society of the Snow</em> (2023)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-pDak4qLyF4Q\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>You might be familiar with the true story of the 1972 Uruguayan rugby team lost in the Andes following a plane crash&mdash;the incident has been the subject of multiple documentaries and two previous dramas, including Frank Marshall's 1993 <em>Alive</em>. This is probably the best take on the tragedy, a thoughtful and tastefully thrilling drama. Director J. A. Bayona emphasizes both the heart-stopping physical perils faced by the team, and the spiritual toll their survival takes on them.</p><hr><h2><em>Missing</em> (2023)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-seBixtcx19E\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>A particularly effective take on screenlife (a sub-genre that's a bit like found footage, except that all the action is shown from the point of view of a computer or mobile device), the micro-budgeted <em>Missing</em> made a very solid showing at the 2023 box office. Storm Reid plays June Allen, the daughter of single mother Grace (Nia Long). June is thrilled that her overprotective mom is heading off on vacation with her new boyfriend&mdash;until she doesn't come back. June sets out to investigate Grace's disappearance from afar, getting some help from Columbian gig worker Javier (Joaquim de Almeida). Given that this is pretty much how we experience life now, the aesthetic isn't all that weird, and the suspense ratchets higher and higher with every click into darker corners of the internet.</p><hr><h2><em>I Don&rsquo;t Feel at Home in This World Anymore</em> (2017)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-a891D5_bGY4\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>When nursing assistant Ruth (a fabulous Melanie Lynskey) comes home to find that she&rsquo;s been burglarized, she sets out with her neighbor (Elijah Wood) to get her stuff back, and get revenge, in the most incompetent manner possible. As a vigilante farce, it nearly reaches Coen-brothers levels of absurdity, but it hits a lot of those beats while alternately challenging and confirming our worst instincts about our fellow humans.</p><hr><h2><em>The Pale Blue Eye </em>(2022)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-ddbL9jvg77w\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>This broody mystery is a compelling (and twisty) tale that plays fast and loose with history, even as it conjures up a chilly and brooding atmosphere. Christian Bale plays a retired and troubled detective teaming up with a young West Point cadet you might have heard of: his name&rsquo;s Edgar Allen Poe, and he&rsquo;s played here by Harry Melling, who&rsquo;s great. The two team up to solve a case involving dead students and creepy occult signifiers.</p><hr><h2><em>The Killer</em> (2023)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-5S7FR_HCg9g\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Michael Fassbender plays the titular (nameless) hitman, a fastidious and ruthless killer who is suffering from the fallout of the first mistake of his career&mdash;accidentally shooting the wrong person, whoops&mdash;as his carefully managed life begins crumbling faster than he can shore it up. Very unlike his previous Netflix original, <em>Mank</em>, this is about as close as Fincher gets to a pure action thrill ride.</p><hr><h2><em>Oldboy</em> (2003)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-tAaBkFChaRg\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>A cult classic that was long difficult to watch in the U.S., <em>Oldboy</em> has finally made it to Netflix. Now broad North American audiences can see what all the fuss is about when it comes to this absolutely batshit South Korean thriller. Choi Min-sik plays Oh Dae-su, a businessman mysteriously imprisoned in a hotel room for 15 years. He doesn't know why he was held, and doesn't know why he's been released at the start of the movie's present day. His ultra-violent, ultra-stylish quest for revenge leads him smack dab into a <em>unbelievably</em> wild twist. </p><hr><h2><em>Bird Box</em> (2018)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-o2AsIXSh2xo\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>This Netflix original had a cultural moment way back in 2018, riding the success of <em>A Quiet Place</em> with a story about creatures<em> YOU MUST NOT LOOK AT</em>. Sandra Bullock leads an impressive cast that includes John Malkovich, Sarah Paulson, Lil Rel Howery, and BD Wong in a post-apocalypse in which the only way to survive is with a blindfold and, perhaps, a stylish puffer jacket.</p><hr><h2><em>Cam</em> (2018)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-pN8xZ5WDonk\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Director Daniel Goldhaber (the upcoming <em>How to Blow Up a Pipeline</em>) teamed up with writer Isa Mazzei, who based this <em>Black Mirror</em>-esque story partly on her own memoir. Madeline Brewer (<em>Orange is the New Black</em>) plays online sex worker Alice Ackerman, aka Lola_Lola, who once night discovers there&rsquo;s another Lola out there&mdash;a cam girl who&rsquo;s identical to Alice in appearance and general vibe, but whose willingness to go further puts her out in front in terms of viewership. It&rsquo;s a horror movie with a lot to say about the dehumanization of sex workers, with a great central performance from Brewer.</p><hr><h2><em>Berlin Syndrome</em> (2017)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-Y8tpKbrN9Uo\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Travel broadens the mind and expands horizons&mdash;unless you&rsquo;re American <em>and</em> in a thriller, in which case you should absolutely stay home. Teresa Palmer plays Clare, a photographer from Brisbane on a trip to Berlin who meets and falls for (at least in a one-night-stand kind of way) a local named Andi, played by Max Riemelt. After a night together, the kind-seeming and perpetually calm Andi isn&rsquo;t keen on letting her leave.</p><hr><h2><em>The Guilty</em> (2021)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-NaB_ERMAZu4\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not quite up to the standard of the Danish original, but this American remake of a 2018 film is still excellent. Director Antoine Fuqua is joined by screenwriter Nic Pizzolatto (<em>True Detective</em>) in the film starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Joe Baylor, an LAPD officer who&rsquo;d been busted down to 911 dispatcher for initially unspecified errors in judgment. He gets a call from a  panicked woman that leads him to make some dramatic decisions, not all of them good. An exercise in pure suspense, the contained movie very much rests on Gyllenhaal&rsquo;s shoulders, though a few famous names show up via voiceover.</p><hr><h2><em>Shimmer Lake</em> (2017)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-sm_hwxNTAa0\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>This crime drama begins on a Friday, with Andy (Rainn Wilson) hiding in his basement while his wife stalls his brother Zeke (Benjamin Walker), who&rsquo;s also the sheriff. Andy, on the run with a bag of money, will be dead before the day&rsquo;s out, but we&rsquo;re going backwards here: writer/director Oren Uziel&rsquo;s narrative then takes us to Thursday, and each previous day subsequently, until we understand how everyone wound up where they are. </p><hr><h2><em>The Devil&rsquo;s Own</em> (1997)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-M8Ke-xzfzQ8\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>As a movie that does an even halfway decent job of dealing with the conflicts around Northern Ireland during the period of the Troubles, <em>The Devil&rsquo;s Own</em> isn&rsquo;t it. But the quiet tension between Harrison Ford&rsquo;s Irish-American police sergeant and the IRA partisan (Brad Pitt) whom he unknowingly welcomes into his home is compelling enough to make up for some slightly silly plotting. Pitt&rsquo;s character is in New York to buy arms, while Ford&rsquo;s character will have to stop him, even as his own sympathies are divided.</p><hr><h2><em>Gerald&rsquo;s Game</em> (2017)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-twbGU2CqqQU\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Set entirely in an isolated cabin in the woods, this Stephen King adaptation involves a single immobilized character for much of its running time. Director Mike Flanagan, nevertheless, manages to craft a taut, suspenseful story about a married woman (Carla Gugino) trapped in a remote cabin when her husband played by Bruce Greenwood, dies after having handcuffed her to the bed. Increasingly delirious, she&rsquo;s forced to face not only her past trauma, but the hungry dog that keeps sniffing around.</p><hr><h2><em>Lou</em> (2022)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-QILhvR4QPsQ\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Lou (Allison Janney) is a quiet loner on Orcas Island in 1986; she&rsquo;s also landlady to Hannah (Jurnee Smollett). Lou has just come by to tell Hannah that the rent is due when she learns that Hannah&rsquo;s daughter has been kidnapped by the girl&rsquo;s father, an ex-Green Beret and war criminal. Fortunately for Hannah, Lou has some very John Wick-esque secrets regarding her past, making her an unexpectedly good ally against the kidnapper.</p><hr><h2><em>Luther: The Fallen Sun</em> (2023)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-EGK5qtXuc1Q\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Continuing from the British crime series starring Idris Elba, but also a movie you can watch on its own, the film finds disgraced, imprisoned former DCI John Luther taunted by a serial killer (Andy Serkis) who, he&rsquo;s pretty sure, can only be stopped if Luther busts out of jail and hunts him down. If you watched the series, this is an essential follow-up. If you haven&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a perfectly good time to find out why Elba is doing the morally-gray detective thing better than anyone, maybe ever.</p><hr><h2><em>Captain Phillips</em> (2013)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-GEyM01dAxp8\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>We don&rsquo;t often find Tom Hanks in a genuine thriller, but he&rsquo;s impressive here in this biopic about the title&rsquo;s Rich Phillips and the 21st century pirates who hijack his container vessel out of Oman. The result is an impossibly tense two hours, supported by an Academy Award-nominated performance from Barkhad Abdi as the pirate leader. <em>Pirates of the Caribbean,</em> this is not.</p><hr><h2><em>Backcountry</em> (2014)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-46uwmzTf5nA\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Look, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/18-movies-to-snort-before-cocaine-bear-1849855262\" target=\"_blank\">bears are not all coke-addled fiends</a>, OK? Sometimes they'll try to chase you down just because! <em>Backcountry</em> is a great way to experience the thrill of being hunted by a man-eating black bear without the inconvenience of actually being eaten. Based very loosely on a true story, this survival thriller sees a couple (Missy Peregrym and Jeff Roop) trying to work out their relationship issues by going off-trail in a Canadian provincial park. Bad idea. It's a great debut for director Adam MacDonald, who went on to helm the justifiably acclaimed supernatural horror flick <em>Pyewacket</em>.</p><hr><h2><em>Creep</em> (2014)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-Gp7tBypjwDo\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Mark Duplass (<em>The Morning Show</em>) co-writes and stars alongside director/co-writer Patrick Brice in this sly, spin on the found footage genre. Filmmaker Aaron (Brice) answers an ad from Josef (Duplass) who says he wants to document his life for the benefit of his unborn child. Things start off normal enough, but then Josef's requests keep getting more and more bizarre, and Aaron's car keys go missing. The slightly comedic vibe, at least at the outset, only serves to make the whole affair more unsettling.</p><hr><h2><em>Fractured</em> (2019)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-sCimThZW-Ew\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>This is a solid example of that type of thriller in which one person realizes someone has disappeared, and everyone else acts like that person was never around at all. (If it's not quite a sub-genre, it's definitely a thing.) After an accident at an exposed construction site, Ray (Sam Worthington) takes his family to the hospital, then dozes off in the waiting room. Big mistake: When he wakes up, they're gone, and the hospital has no idea what he's talking about. If it isn't entirely original, it's still a fun and creepy mystery.</p><hr><h2><em>Emily the Criminal</em> (2022)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-Xzf1YCEkLDI\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Emily (Aubrey Plaza) is a deeply relatable character: She went to an expensive school, and finds herself saddled with a mountain of debt. A relatively minor criminal record has made it hard for her to get a good-paying job. When given a chance to learn all about credit card fraud, the potential benefits are too good to turn down&mdash;which is approximately when things go wrong, and get violent. And then we find out exactly what Emily is capable of. Plaza is so brilliant here as the anti-hero that it&rsquo;s a little hard not to cheer her on.</p><hr><h2><em>The Paramedic</em> (2020)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-2qKPbHhyGrI\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Mario Casas stars here as &Aacute;ngel, the title&rsquo;s paramedic&mdash;not the greatest guy, really, and one who takes souvenirs from the people he helps, either to sell or to keep. An accident sees him lose the use of his legs, and his turmoil and rage don&rsquo;t turn him into a better person, but instead sees him letting loose on a world he blames for pretty much everything. In particular danger is the girlfriend who left him. It&rsquo;s a standard horror/thriller setup, but Casas is impressively compelling in his transformation from run-of-the-mill jerk to complete monster.</p><hr><h2><em>The Gray Man</em> (2022)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-BmllggGO4pM\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The Russo brothers took a break from <em>Avengers</em> movies for this <em>other</em> blockbuster&mdash;at a cost of around $200m, it&rsquo;s not like they decided to do a quiet indie drama. Ryan Gosling plays spy Sierra Six, whose latest mission involves taking out a fellow agent. He&rsquo;s soon on the run from a corrupt agency boss (played by Reg&eacute;-Jean Page), and helped and hindered by a supporting cast including Billy Bob Thornton, Ana de Armas, Chris Evans, and Alfre Woodard. Sierra Six doesn&rsquo;t make much of an impression as a character, but the Russos know how to craft an action spectacle, and this one kicks up the action early on, and never really slows down.</p><hr><h2><em>I Care a Lot </em>(2020)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-D40uHmTSPew\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Rosamund Pike&rsquo;s Marla Grayson might be the worst character on this list, which is definitely saying a lot. She&rsquo;s a con artist who specializes in convincing courts to grant her guardianship of old people who, she says, can&rsquo;t take care of themselves. She then drains their bank accounts at her leisure. It&rsquo;s all going great (for her)  until she fucks with the wrong senior: in this case, Jennifer Peterson (Dianne Wiest), who looks like the ultimate score. It turns out that she&rsquo;s the mom of a scary Russian mobster (Peter Dinklage), and things escalate from there. The tone here is satirical to the point of comedy, but it&rsquo;s both tense and satisfying to see the screws turn on Marla.</p><hr><h2><em>Hold the Dark</em> (2018)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-OFAwDO6b5KI\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Jeffrey Wright plays Russell Core, a writer and wolf expert summoned by Riley Keogh's Medora Slone to investigate the disappearance of three small kids in rural Alaska. Not all the locals are convinced that wolves are to blame&mdash;or, at least, that it was <em>just</em> wolves. The return of Medora's husband (Alexander Skarsg&aring;rd) from Iraq only complicates the mystery further. If you've seen director Jeremy Saulnier's previous feature <em>Green Room</em>, you'll have a sense of the dark tone and grimy aesthetic in store for you.</p><hr><h2><em>The Occupant</em> (2020)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-DsHcN40GhCI\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Advertising executive Javier Mu&ntilde;oz (Javier Guti&eacute;rrez) once lived with his family in an ultra-posh apartment, but they simply couldn't afford once he lost his job. Reduced circumstances have them in a tiny rental in a less-than-coveted neighborhood of Barcelona&mdash;but there's this set of spare keys, you see, and Javier can't help but go and scope out his old home and the new family that lives there. His interest quickly turns to an obsession with getting his old place back...though in fairness, none of his actions seem all that wild given today's real estate market.</p><hr><h2><em>The Little Things</em> (2021)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-1HZAnkxdYuA\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>This 1990s period piece stars Denzel Washington and Rami Malek as detectives investigating a string of murders in Los Angeles. As they start to suspect a weird loner (Jared Leto), the pair find that the case has ties to Washington's past. It's a familiar piece of genre fare in many ways, but the performances from the three leads elevate the material significantly. (Yes, even Leto.)</p><hr><h2><em>A Simple Favor</em> (2018)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-rAqMlh0b2HU\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The darkly comedic tone makes this one bit lighter than many of the other films on this list, but it's all the more twisted for it. It all starts when mommy blogger Stephanie (Anna Kendrick) makes friends with, and unwisely confides in, Emily (Blake Lively), a PR director and mother of her son's schoolmate. Then Emily disappears, Stephanie sleeps with Emily's husband (Henry Golding), and the lurid secrets that Stephanie spilled start to come to light under shocking circumstances. It's all lot of fun, and boasts some genuinely wild twists.</p>"

						"__cdata": "<p>There are tons of things that kids can love about gardening: digging, picking, identifying color and texture and taste. If you&rsquo;ve got a small spot of the yard to dedicate to the endeavor, why not create a garden for your kids? You can keep it very simple, using &ldquo;cut and come again&rdquo; vegetables and flowers, and vegetables that are prolific and unfussy.&nbsp;You can find all these seeds and plants at your local nursery. </p><h2>The plants you'll need</h2><p>Here's what I recommend for your children's garden: </p><ul><li><p>Cherry tomato start</p></li><li><p>Sunflower seeds or starts</p></li><li><p>Lettuce seeds</p></li><li><p>Radish seeds</p></li><li><p>Beet seeds</p></li><li><p>1 six pack of green beans</p></li><li><p>1 six pack of carrot starts</p></li><li><p>1 pumpkin start</p></li><li><p>1 cucumber start</p></li></ul><p>Cherry tomatoes are almost guaranteed success, with prolific and enduring harvests. If you went with a full-sized tomato, there&rsquo;s too much chance of prematurely picking a tomato before it&rsquo;s done, or a mood being ruined when that tomato is hit by blossom end rot or worms. If you choose a mid-height sunflower, you&rsquo;ll be able to cut them and have them grow side shoots over the season, or you can simply leave them to bloom and bring the bees. As long as you water religiously, the seeds of lettuce, radishes and beets should germinate easily. Pulling the radishes and beets out can be extremely satisfying for young kids, and you can pick leaves off the lettuce and it will grow back.&nbsp;</p><p>I suggest carrot starts instead of seeds because carrots are notoriously hard to germinate and long to come to size. Cucumbers will round out the possible salads from the bed, and a pumpkin will be the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance at the end of the season when the rest of the garden is spent. You can save the pumpkin seeds from this year&rsquo;s jack o&rsquo;lantern for next year&rsquo;s garden.&nbsp;</p><h2>Laying out the garden</h2><p>In laying out the garden, you want to use the seeds to separate the tomatoes on one side from the pumpkins on the other. Here's my suggested layout.&nbsp;Starting on one side, plant the tomato plant. Remember that tomatoes need support, so use a tomato cage or another trellis and add it early. They&rsquo;re hard to put on later. Now plant rows of lettuce, radish, beets and carrots and beans across the bed. Make sure the beans are last. At the other end, place the pumpkin at the top of the bed and the cucumber below it. Plant a few sunflowers (no more than two or three) in the corners of the bed. In between the beans and cucumber, place a trellis so the beans and cucumber can climb.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J28FXMAGSDDEJMW7W526QGJH/images-1.fill.size_2000x1379.v1720419537.png\" alt=\"garden layout sketch\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1379\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J28FXMAGSDDEJMW7W526QGJH/images-1.fill.size_800x552.v1720419537.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J28FXMAGSDDEJMW7W526QGJH/images-1.fill.size_1400x966.v1720419537.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J28FXMAGSDDEJMW7W526QGJH/images-1.fill.size_2000x1379.v1720419537.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\"></span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Amanda Blum</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<h2>Maintaining your garden</h2><p>You'll need to water the bed once a day, first thing in the morning. You want to water so you can feel moist soil when you stick your finger about six inches into the bed. Within a few weeks the sunflowers and other seeds should germinate, and a month after planting, it&rsquo;ll be time to thin the radishes, beets and lettuce to one healthy seedling every six inches.&nbsp;</p><p>The crops will all be ready for harvest at different times, but each of these crops offers an opportunity to pick, grab and dig, with lots of different textures and colors. You should be able to make a few salads from the crops, and even have green beans with a number of meals. Everything in this bed can be eaten without cooking, so you can snack in the garden.&nbsp;</p>"

There's also a feature that allows you to mark areas that aren't actually great for walking, which will train the application not to include such areas going forward, though again, the information itself remains local to your device and is not uploaded to a server.</p><p>Overall, Strolly is a very simple app, but that's the point.

(Memorize this! Pronounce it &ldquo;Edwin Shirdloo,&rdquo; like a name, and pretend he&rsquo;s a friend of yours.)</p><p>Four of today's letters are from our mnemonic. The other is fairly common.</p><h2>Can you give me a hint for today&rsquo;s Wordle?</h2><p>To form, mold, or create. </p><h2>Does today&rsquo;s Wordle have any double or repeated letters?</h2><p>There are no repeated letters today.&nbsp;</p><h2>How many vowels are in today&rsquo;s Wordle?</h2><p>There are two vowels. </p><h2>What letter does today&rsquo;s Wordle start with?</h2><p>Today&rsquo;s word starts with S.&nbsp;</p><h2>What letter does today&rsquo;s Wordle end with?</h2><p>Today&rsquo;s word ends with E.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is the solution to today&rsquo;s Wordle?</h2><p>Ready? Today&rsquo;s word is SHAPE.</p><h2>How I solved today&rsquo;s Wordle</h2><p>I started with RAISE then guessed DITCH assuming I likely wasn't looking for any additional vowels and instead wanted to eliminate common consonants. I then guessed CLAMP, which knocked out other possible consonants and narrowed down vowel location. SHAPE was the only remaining solution. </p><pre class=\"border-2 border-gray-400 bg-gray-100 p-4 text-black shadow-md\">Wordle 1,115 4/6\n\n&#11035;&#129000;&#11035;&#129000;&#129001;\n&#11035;&#11035;&#11035;&#11035;&#129000;\n&#11035;&#11035;&#129001;&#11035;&#129000;\n&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;</pre>\n<hr><h2>Yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle answer</h2><p>Yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle was medium difficult. The hint was &ldquo;artillery on a pirate ship&rdquo; and the answer contained four common letters and one fairly common letters. </p><p>The answer to yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle was CANON. </p><h2>A primer on Wordle basics</h2><p>The idea of Wordle is to guess the day&rsquo;s secret word. When you first open the Wordle game, you&rsquo;ll see an empty grid of letters. It&rsquo;s up to <em>you</em> to make the first move: type in any five-letter word.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, you can use the colors that are revealed to get clues about the word:&nbsp;<strong>Green</strong> means you correctly guessed a letter, and it&rsquo;s in the correct position. (For example, if you guess PARTY, and the word is actually PURSE, the P and R will be green.)</p><ul><li><p><strong>Yellow</strong> means the letter is somewhere in the word, but not in the position you guessed it. (For example, if you guessed PARTY, but the word is actually ROAST, the R, A and T will all be yellow.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Gray</strong> means the letter is not in the solution word at all. (If you guessed PARTY and everything is gray, then the solution <em>cannot</em> be PURSE or ROAST.)</p></li></ul><p>With all that in mind, guess another word, and then another, trying to land on the correct word before you run out of chances. You get six guesses, and then it&rsquo;s game over.</p><h2>The best starter words for Wordle</h2><p>What should you play for that first guess? The best starters tend to contain common letters, to increase the chances of getting yellow and green squares to guide your guessing. (And if you get all grays when guessing common letters, that&rsquo;s <em>still</em> excellent information to help you rule out possibilities.) There isn&rsquo;t a single &ldquo;best&rdquo; starting word, but the New York Times&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/this-bot-can-tell-you-how-good-you-really-are-at-wordle-1848769075\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Wordle analysis bot</u></a> has suggested starting with one of these:</p><ul><li><p>CRANE</p></li><li><p>TRACE</p></li><li><p>SLANT</p></li><li><p>CRATE</p></li><li><p>CARTE</p></li></ul><p>Meanwhile, an MIT analysis <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/science-thinks-it-has-found-the-best-wordle-starter-1849541276\" target=\"_blank\"><u>found</u></a> that you&rsquo;ll eliminate the most possibilities in the first round by starting with one of these:</p><ul><li><p>SALET</p></li><li><p>REAST</p></li><li><p>TRACE</p></li><li><p>CRATE</p></li><li><p>SLATE</p></li></ul><p>Other good picks might be ARISE or ROUND. Words like ADIEU and AUDIO get more vowels in play, but you could argue that it&rsquo;s better to start with an emphasis on consonants, using a starter like RENTS or CLAMP. Choose your strategy, and see how it plays out.</p><h2>How to win at Wordle</h2><p>We have a few guides to Wordle strategy, which you might like to read over if you&rsquo;re a serious student of the game. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-win-at-wordle-according-to-my-wife-1848480285\" target=\"_blank\"><u>This one</u></a> covers how to use consonants to your advantage, while <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-master-or-cheat-at-wordle-the-internets-favor-1848312354\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this one</u></a> focuses on a strategy that uses the most common letters. In <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-try-quordle-if-youre-too-good-at-wordle-1848540319\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this advanced guide</u></a>, we detail a three-pronged approach for fishing for hints while maximizing your chances of winning quickly.</p><p>The biggest thing that separates Wordle winners from Wordle losers is that winners <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-lost-wordle-today-1850348061\" target=\"_blank\"><u>use their guesses to gather information about what letters are in the word</u></a>. If you know that the word must end in -OUND, don&rsquo;t waste four guesses on MOUND, ROUND, SOUND, and HOUND; combine those consonants and guess MARSH. If the H lights up in yellow, you know the solution.</p><p>One more note on strategy: the original Wordle used a list of about 2,300 solution words, but after the game was bought by the NYT, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/wordle-has-themes-now-so-you-should-change-your-strate-1849840529\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the game now has an editor who hand-picks the solutions</u></a>.

The hint was &ldquo;as a noun, something you have as a teenager; as a verb, to squeeze or press&rdquo; and the answer contained four common letters and one fairly common letter. </p><p>The answer to yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle was CRUSH. </p><h2>A primer on Wordle basics</h2><p>The idea of Wordle is to guess the day&rsquo;s secret word. When you first open the Wordle game, you&rsquo;ll see an empty grid of letters. It&rsquo;s up to <em>you</em> to make the first move: type in any five-letter word.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, you can use the colors that are revealed to get clues about the word:&nbsp;<strong>Green</strong> means you correctly guessed a letter, and it&rsquo;s in the correct position. (For example, if you guess PARTY, and the word is actually PURSE, the P and R will be green.)</p><ul><li><p><strong>Yellow</strong> means the letter is somewhere in the word, but not in the position you guessed it. (For example, if you guessed PARTY, but the word is actually ROAST, the R, A and T will all be yellow.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Gray</strong> means the letter is not in the solution word at all. (If you guessed PARTY and everything is gray, then the solution <em>cannot</em> be PURSE or ROAST.)</p></li></ul><p>With all that in mind, guess another word, and then another, trying to land on the correct word before you run out of chances. You get six guesses, and then it&rsquo;s game over.</p><h2>The best starter words for Wordle</h2><p>What should you play for that first guess? The best starters tend to contain common letters, to increase the chances of getting yellow and green squares to guide your guessing. (And if you get all grays when guessing common letters, that&rsquo;s <em>still</em> excellent information to help you rule out possibilities.) There isn&rsquo;t a single &ldquo;best&rdquo; starting word, but the New York Times&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/this-bot-can-tell-you-how-good-you-really-are-at-wordle-1848769075\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Wordle analysis bot</u></a> has suggested starting with one of these:</p><ul><li><p>CRANE</p></li><li><p>TRACE</p></li><li><p>SLANT</p></li><li><p>CRATE</p></li><li><p>CARTE</p></li></ul><p>Meanwhile, an MIT analysis <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/science-thinks-it-has-found-the-best-wordle-starter-1849541276\" target=\"_blank\"><u>found</u></a> that you&rsquo;ll eliminate the most possibilities in the first round by starting with one of these:</p><ul><li><p>SALET</p></li><li><p>REAST</p></li><li><p>TRACE</p></li><li><p>CRATE</p></li><li><p>SLATE</p></li></ul><p>Other good picks might be ARISE or ROUND. Words like ADIEU and AUDIO get more vowels in play, but you could argue that it&rsquo;s better to start with an emphasis on consonants, using a starter like RENTS or CLAMP. Choose your strategy, and see how it plays out.</p><h2>How to win at Wordle</h2><p>We have a few guides to Wordle strategy, which you might like to read over if you&rsquo;re a serious student of the game. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-win-at-wordle-according-to-my-wife-1848480285\" target=\"_blank\"><u>This one</u></a> covers how to use consonants to your advantage, while <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-master-or-cheat-at-wordle-the-internets-favor-1848312354\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this one</u></a> focuses on a strategy that uses the most common letters. In <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-try-quordle-if-youre-too-good-at-wordle-1848540319\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this advanced guide</u></a>, we detail a three-pronged approach for fishing for hints while maximizing your chances of winning quickly.</p><p>The biggest thing that separates Wordle winners from Wordle losers is that winners <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-lost-wordle-today-1850348061\" target=\"_blank\"><u>use their guesses to gather information about what letters are in the word</u></a>. If you know that the word must end in -OUND, don&rsquo;t waste four guesses on MOUND, ROUND, SOUND, and HOUND; combine those consonants and guess MARSH. If the H lights up in yellow, you know the solution.</p><p>One more note on strategy: the original Wordle used a list of about 2,300 solution words, but after the game was bought by the NYT, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/wordle-has-themes-now-so-you-should-change-your-strate-1849840529\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the game now has an editor who hand-picks the solutions</u></a>. Sometimes they are slightly tricky words that wouldn&rsquo;t have made the original list, and sometimes they are topical. For example, FEAST was the solution one Thanksgiving. So keep in mind that there may be a theme.</p><h2>Wordle alternatives</h2><p>If you can&rsquo;t get enough of five-letter guessing games and their kin, the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-10-best-wordle-alternatives-ranked-by-difficulty-1848859009\" target=\"_blank\"><u>best Wordle alternatives</u></a>, ranked by difficulty, include:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://wheelsrpgs.itch.io/wheeldle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Wheeldle, which lets you play one puzzle after another</u></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://zaratustra.itch.io/dordle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Dordle</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/games/quordle/#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Quordle</u></a>, which ask you to play two (Dordle) or four (Quordle) puzzles at the same time, with the same guesses.

						"__cdata": "<p>I hate cleaning, which presents a real predicament for someone (me) who makes a mess in the kitchen every day. Often my boyfriend cleans up after me&mdash;he is kind and I feed him&mdash;but the time has come where I feel like I have to try to make more of an effort. I bought a kitchen vacuum, and I'm happy to report that it's made us both happier.&nbsp;</p><p>There&rsquo;s the obvious kitchen messes&mdash;spilled coffee, oil splatters on the stove, or never-ending dishes&mdash;and those need relatively immediate individual treatment. The other kind of kitchen mess is more sinister, lurking, growing silently until you open the silverware drawer and realize how embarrassed you would be if a friend came over and went to get a fork. It&rsquo;s miscellaneous crumbs. It sounds like no big deal, but that&rsquo;s exactly the kind of attitude they prey on.</p><p>&ldquo;Crumb&rdquo; is the word I&rsquo;m using for bits of dry material that collect in the drawers, cabinet edges, corners of the counter, and in the weird ledges of your oven door. &ldquo;Crumbs&rdquo; includes more than bits of dry food&mdash;it&rsquo;s fuzz, dust, seeds, arm hairs, pet hairs, coffee grinds, and random particulate crap that is mostly unidentifiable. This is the stuff that slowly builds up in weirdest, most annoying-to-clean crevices. That&rsquo;s where the kitchen vacuum comes in.&nbsp;</p><h2>What to look for when buying your kitchen vac</h2><p>A kitchen vacuum is not unlike a car vacuum in that it&rsquo;s designed to be handheld, but they're usually even smaller and very lightweight. There's no plugging in to bother with, and they're easy to click on. Within seconds, you can banish a cluster of crumbs, turn it off, stow it, and get back to your life. This spells success for me. No fussing, no sponges or paper towels needed, and so fast that it barely interrupts my task. </p><p>I recommend keeping yours in an area of the kitchen that's easy to access, and try to resist using it all around your house. The whole point is that it doesn't end up living in your car or your son's room. Maybe those spaces need a vacuum too, but this one stays in the kitchen. It will inevitably collect food particles, and it's best if those stay close to (and in) the trash, not in other parts of your home.  Here are design features and accessories to consider as you shop for your own.</p><p><strong>Slim design.</strong> Make sure the entire vacuum has a narrow body, and isn&rsquo;t too long. This makes it easy to maneuver it around edges and get into cabinets easily. The whole reason kitchen vacuums make life easy is because you don&rsquo;t really have to move anything out of the way in order to clean around it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wireless is the way.</strong> All corded vacuums are annoying, but a cord in the kitchen can really ruin your day. Most outlets are situated above the countertop so that appliances can easily reach them, but a vacuum cord plugged into the countertop outlet can easily knock things over. Trust me, I&rsquo;ve broken a couple glasses this way. Look for a vacuum that has a rechargeable power station and long battery life.</p><p><strong>The nozzle attachment is key.</strong> Most small handheld vacs have a tapered suck point. This is good for countertop messes where you have access to a wide area, or big, chunky crumbs. However, a slim, long nozzle attachment with an angled opening is the most effective tool for getting into corners and cleaning up along raised edges. Personally, that&rsquo;s where all my kitchen crumbs end up.</p><p>I keep my <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/DdBXe?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Explainers&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Shark%20cordless%20hand%20vac&amp;short_url=DdBXe&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Shark cordless hand vac</u></a> on an easily accessible shelf in the kitchen, so as soon as I see a congregation of crumbs, I&rsquo;m ready to attack. I do this a couple times a week, and it&rsquo;s made all the difference between &ldquo;tidy&rdquo; and &ldquo;spotless&rdquo; in my kitchen. If any of the below strike your fancy, give one a try and join me in a life of simplified kitchen maintenance.</p><hr><h3>Kitchen vacuums to consider:</h3><div class=\"shadow-b-2 mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-[#F0F0F0] px-6 py-2 shadow-lg md:px-12\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Products List\" x-data=\"{ showMore: false }\">\n                        <a href=\"https://cc.lifehacker.com/v1/otc/06ZVRiLmglGs4QA6plTXzTC?merchant=05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FShark-WV201BK-Cordless-Lightweight-One-Touch%2Fdp%2FB0CBSV2TNM%2Fref%3Dasc_df_B0CBSV2TNM%2F&amp;template=Explainers&amp;module=shop-card&amp;element=offer&amp;item=whole-shop-card&amp;position=&amp;element_label=Shark+Cordless+Hand+Vac&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss&amp;product_uuid=05t65qgwYAzC42lFdDFLeIK&amp;offer_uuid=01mY5PwraEo1iGFYq8PC0Aq&amp;object_type=01mY5PwraEo1iGFYq8PC0Aq&amp;object_uuid=05t65qgwYAzC42lFdDFLeIK\" data-commerce=\"1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" data-parent-group=\"affiliate-link\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\" class=\"flex flex-col py-8 gap-5 border-dotted border-[#CFCFCE] cursor-default no-underline md:flex-row md:gap-y-2 md:py-7 border-b-2\" data-ga-click=\"data-ga-click\" data-ga-item=\"whole-shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Shark Cordless Hand Vac\" aria-label=\"Shark Cordless Hand Vac Product Card\" x-cloak=\"x-cloak\" x-show=\"showMore || 0 &lt;

The M3 Pro chip is leaps and bounds better in terms of value than the M3 for those looking for the best performance&mdash;and for those who can afford it. It comes with 18GB of RAM (10 more GB than the entry level M3 MacBook Pro), an 11&#8209;core CPU, and 14&#8209;core GPU M3 Pro chip. You also get about eight hours more battery life than the 14.2-inch M3 MacBook Pro. The M3 Pro is just a more powerful engine, although there are no upgrades in the display&mdash;so if the RAM and chip processing power is not what you're after, the standard M3 MacBook Pro is the better choice. You can find this one for <strong>$1,699</strong> (originally $1,999) after a $300 discount on Amazon.

						"__cdata": "<p>YouTube quietly celebrated Independence Day this week by previewing a new feature that uses AI to help creators declare independence from copyright strikes.</p><p>One of the most annoying parts of streaming or making YouTube videos for a living is when copyrighted music accidentally makes its way into your videos. If you don&rsquo;t catch it early, you could be out on all of the money that video earns, and could get in trouble with YouTube itself.</p><p>Sometimes, this catches piracy. Often, it catches people who stumble across a licensed song in a video game or in the background of their vlog. For live video, not muting quickly enough could demonetize the stream&rsquo;s archive, while creators making edited video might have to spend hours painstakingly isolating a song from the rest of their work.</p><p>YouTube&rsquo;s had an &ldquo;Erase Song&rdquo; tool in beta for a while now, but the company wasn&rsquo;t proud of its efficacy. Now, it&rsquo;s updating the feature with a new AI algorithm that will scan a video for copyrighted music and give creators two options.</p><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-otORVHgj1T0\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Erase Song</strong> will use AI to attempt to intelligently mute just the offending music while leaving the rest of your audio intact, while <strong>Mute all sound</strong> will work as a fallback to mute a video for the duration of a copyright protected song.</p><p>While YouTube is promising better performance with the updated tool, a company <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2902117?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>support page</u></a> says it &ldquo;might not work if the song is too hard to remove,&rdquo; hence the need for a fallback.</p><p>Unfortunately, Erase Song is only available once a video has been copyright claimed, which means it can&rsquo;t be used proactively. To access it, go to your copyright claim summary page and click on <strong>Select Action</strong> in the lower right corner of the screen. Click on <strong>Erase Song</strong>, then choose <strong>Erase Song</strong> (yes, again) to use AI to intelligently remove just the claimed audio. Alternatively, click on <strong>Mute all sound in the claimed segments</strong> if you&rsquo;re not confident in what the AI can do. You can preview your edited video before finalizing your claim, and if you&rsquo;re muting all sound in a claimed segment, you can either use suggested timestamps or customize your own.</p><p>The YouTube support page says that &ldquo;if all claimed audio can be muted, the Content ID claim will be removed from your video,&rdquo; meaning creators can use this system to avoid having to argue with a representative.</p><p>Erase Song joins other similar tools like Replace Song, which allows creators to replace a copyright claimed song with royalty free music, and Trim Out Segment, which just removes the copyright claimed part of a video in its entirety.</p>"

Keep in mind there is no way to turn off the ANC with these earbuds, but you can always turn on Aware mode if you want to be able to hear your surroundings. </p><p>You'll get between six and seven hours of juice with these earbuds. The charging case can provide about 18 hours of battery life. The case doesn't support wireless charging and takes three hours to fully charge from empty, with 20 minutes of charging giving you up to two hours of listening time.</p>"

					"thumbnail": "",
					"encoded": {
						"__cdata": "<p>There are so many <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/best-productivity-methods-1850862925\" target=\"_blank\">productivity techniques</a> out there and a lot of them can feel pretty intense. They might involve turning your to-dos into data, creating elaborate matrixes to prioritize your tasks, or listing everything you have to do before assigning it a grade based on a subjective scale. All of that takes time. The \"7 Minute Life\" framework, on the other hand, only takes a few minutes per day and is an effective way to plan what you need to do and stay motivated. Here's how it works. </p><h2>What is the 7 Minute Life?</h2><p>This concept comes from Allyson Lewis, a productivity guru who founded the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/BdBvJ?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=How-To&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=7%20Minute%20Life&amp;short_url=BdBvJ&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">7 Minute Life</a> in an effort to help people feel engaged with their work and interests. Her technique can be applied to a variety of things, <a href=\"https://the7minutelife.com/daily-planning-worksheet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">like unfinished tasks or reaching certain goals</a>, but it's also broad enough for everyday use. </p><p>Essentially, you dedicate seven minutes each morning and night to making decisions about your day and reflecting on what you did and need to do tomorrow. The idea is that you should choose to consciously focus for just those two seven-minute intervals, using that time to make deliberate choices about how you'll spend the rest of the time in your day. Lewis' technique is based on the fact that each day only has 1,440 minutes and 14 minutes only make up 1% of those. The rest of your time, if you plan it right, is all yours, so you should use that 1% of planning and reflecting time to prioritize your tasks and reflect on how it all went. </p><h2>How to use the 7 Minute Life technique</h2><p>Lewis offers courses, coaching, and resources for turning the 7 Minute Life into a whole lifestyle, but you can start small. Every morning, start your day by setting a timer for seven minutes and thinking about what you need to get done.

Like the first book, <a href=\"https://Wondla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><em>Wondla</em></a>, the animated adaptation has a perfect YA set-up: 12-year-old protagonist Eva Nine was raised in an underground bunker by a robot.

This news item, along with decades' worth of others both more and less significant in music and pop culture journalism from MTV News, might have been lost forever were it not for The Internet Archive.&nbsp;</p><p>Days after Paramount, MTV&rsquo;s parent company, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/mtv-news-website-archives-pulled-offline-1236047163/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">pulled the plug </a>on over 20 year&rsquo;s worth of online MTV News content, The Internet Archive added a<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/mtv.com/search/mtv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"> searchable database of 460,575 web pages from </a><a href=\"http://mtv.com/news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">mtv.com/news</a> to its Wayback Machine. The archive isn&rsquo;t complete, and it's not as easy to use as a full website, but it&rsquo;s way better than letting all that info disappear down the memory hole.</p><p>According to a source familiar with Paramount and quoted by <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/mtv-news-articles-internet-archive-wayback-machine-1236058997/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><em>Variety</em></a>, the cost of maintaining and hosting old, low-traffic MTV news pages was higher than the ad revenue they brought in. Paramount&rsquo;s spokesperson categorized the removal of articles from MTV News&rsquo;s as part of &ldquo;broader website changes across Paramount,&rdquo; designed to introduce &ldquo;more streamlined versions&rdquo; of its sites. Paramount has also 86&rsquo;ed thousands of articles from CMT (Country Music Television) and&nbsp;videos from Comedy Central&rsquo;s site, including clips from <em>The Daily Show </em>dating back decades.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is it legal for The Internet Archive to host MTV News&rsquo; old content?</h2><p>The Internet Archive contends that it isn't in violation of copyright law because the content it hosts falls under fair use exception, but it&rsquo;s not clear whether that argument would hold up in court if Paramount asked the Internet Archive to remove MTVNews content and the Archive refused. So if you&rsquo;re into reliving your youth through paging through hoary MTV News articles, you might want to do if now, just in case. </p><p>Last year, a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/publishers-beat-internet-archive-as-judge-rules-e-book-lending-violates-copyright/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">U.S. District Cour</a>t ruled that fair use didn't allow the Internet Archive  the right reproduce the works of book publishers to lend them out to users in a digital lending library, but the<a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/94607-aap-files-brief-opposing-internet-archive-s-bid-to-appeal-ruling-in-infringement-suit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"> Internet Archive is appealing the ruling</a>. </p><h2>How to use The Wayback Machine for any website</h2><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J221Z294NTN7WZWNF3Y3D2XM/images-1.fill.size_2000x1166.v1720203577.png\" alt=\"Wayback Machine\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1166\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J221Z294NTN7WZWNF3Y3D2XM/images-1.fill.size_800x466.v1720203577.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J221Z294NTN7WZWNF3Y3D2XM/images-1.fill.size_1400x816.v1720203577.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J221Z294NTN7WZWNF3Y3D2XM/images-1.fill.size_2000x1166.v1720203577.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\"></span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Stephen Johnson - Internet Archive</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The Wayback Machine can be used to view archived versions of a lot more than just MTV News.

Since it&rsquo;s not specified as being for audio, and because MacRumors said the uncovered code indicates the device will be running a variant of tvOS for its software and homeOS for its firmware, it&rsquo;s probable that this will be an entirely new product, rather than an upgraded smart speaker.&nbsp;Like <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/useful-google-nest-hub-commands\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Google&rsquo;s Nest Hub</u></a>, this could be Apple&rsquo;s approach to a smart home hub with a built-in screen.</p><p>Second is that &ldquo;17,1&rdquo; in the name, which MacRumors says suggests the device will use the A18 chip, making it <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-intelligence-on-iphone-requirements\" target=\"_blank\"><u>capable of running Apple Intelligence</u></a>. Apple Intelligence is coming later this fall, around the same time Apple typically announces new iPhones. It&rsquo;s possible the company will also announce this product in the same window, while also debuting ways for AI to help schedule events, take calls, control lights, or otherwise help out around the house.</p><p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s about all we know for now. Apple&rsquo;s most recent HomePod was the <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-homepod-2nd-generation-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>HomePod (2nd Generation)</u></a>, which came out in January 2023 for $299. Like the original HomePod, it focused heavily on Siri integration, so it would make sense for a new HomePod to debut the upgraded Siri that&rsquo;s coming with Apple Intelligence.</p><p>Outside of the smart home, MacRumors also said it uncovered code that references two unreleased Apple TV models, suggesting updates are on the way for that device as well.</p>"

Not how fast or how slow, but how <em>different</em> a timeframe passes between beats. The differences are only measurable with precise equipment, but here's the basic idea: If your heart goes &ldquo;beat&hellip;beat&hellip;beat&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..beat&hellip;beat..beat&hellip;&hellip;.beat,&rdquo; you have a high HRV, and that&rsquo;s a good thing. On the other hand, if your heart goes &ldquo;beat&hellip;.beat&hellip;.beat...beat&hellip;..beat,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s a low HRV. We tend to have a low HRV when we&rsquo;re stressed or fatigued, and a high HRV when we&rsquo;re either not stressed, or recovering well from our stressors.&nbsp;</p><p>This may seem counterintuitive, because most of us think of an ideal heartbeat as being steady and regular, but subtle variations from one beat to another are healthy and normal. Our heart takes its orders on how fast to beat from two different parts of our nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic). It's thought that a high HRV indicates that the two systems are both active&mdash;balancing each other out, in a sense.</p><p>Your HRV will change from day to day, and that&rsquo;s where these devices come in. You&rsquo;ll often see a change in your HRV numbers right after a hard workout or stressful work day, giving you an early heads up about what your body is dealing with. This information, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-better-way-to-use-your-wearable-s-readiness-data-1850304587\" target=\"_blank\"><u>used wisely</u></a>, can help to guide your workout schedule and your health-related habits.</p><p>What counts as a &ldquo;good&rdquo; HRV depends on your own history; it&rsquo;s not worth comparing yourself to others. (I don&rsquo;t mean that in a feel-good kind of way, but literally, scientifically: your HRV only makes sense when compared to itself.) Whoop <a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/us/en/thelocker/what-is-a-good-hrv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>reports</u></a> that the middle 50% of 20-year-olds have an HRV between about 60 and 105, with numbers declining as we get older. If you&rsquo;re 60, according to that data set, you&rsquo;re likely to have HRV numbers somewhere between 30 and 50.&nbsp;</p><h2>How does HRV differ from resting heart rate (RHR)?</h2><p>Your resting heart rate is <em>also</em> a number that reflects stress on your body, including fatigue and illness. Unlike HRV, a higher resting heart rate means you&rsquo;re more stressed, and a lower one is a sign that you&rsquo;re well recovered.&nbsp;</p><p>Resting heart rate can also change over time as you become more fit. Athletes tend to have lower RHR numbers, and people who take up an exercise habit often find that their RHR declines a bit over time. (That said, RHR isn&rsquo;t a direct measure of cardio fitness; there seems to be a significant genetic component as well. Take me as an example: my RHR is always pretty low, even when my cardio fitness is crap. If I&rsquo;m doing a lot of endurance training, it will drop by two to three points, but no more.)&nbsp;</p><p>Most healthy adults have a resting heart rate of <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/what-your-heart-rate-is-telling-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>between 55 and 85 beats per minut</u></a>e (some sources give 60 to 100 as the typical range). It&rsquo;s important to note that these numbers usually assume that you&rsquo;re sitting quietly in a doctor&rsquo;s office. When you&rsquo;re asleep in your own bed, your heart rate can dip a bit lower. So it&rsquo;s normal to see lower numbers than these on a wearable that records all night.</p><h2>How to track your HRV and resting heart rate with wearables</h2><p>Gone are the days when you may have charged your fitness tracker at night; now, fitness-focused wearables are expected to be worn in your sleep to track these nighttime metrics.&nbsp;</p><p>During the night, your device monitors your heartbeat. It may sample and average different readings, and each device measures and calculates its numbers slightly differently. (That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t expect much agreement between the devices, but more on that in a minute.) When you wake up, you might be presented with a &ldquo;readiness&rdquo; or &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; score, but I stand by my position that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-better-way-to-use-your-wearable-s-readiness-data-1850304587\" target=\"_blank\"><u>HRV and RHR are the only numbers really worth paying attention to</u></a> (aside from time in bed, if you want to monitor your sleep).</p><p>The data will be presented to you in the device&rsquo;s companion app or, in the case of devices with a screen, on the device itself. Often the app or device will tell you how your numbers compare to your usual. What you do with that information is up to you.</p><h2>How I gathered my data</h2><p>For this experiment, I wore my three devices to bed every night.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>I own the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/joxrv?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Explainers&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Oura%20ring&amp;short_url=joxrv&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Oura ring</a> and wear it every night whether I&rsquo;m writing about it or not. I&rsquo;m very used to the numbers I see there. I wore it on my left ring finger.</p></li><li><p>The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/pg5d4?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Explainers&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Forerunner%20265&amp;short_url=pg5d4&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Forerunner 265</a> went on my left wrist. I&rsquo;m testing it out with plans to review all its features soon, so it was natural to wear it to bed and see how it compares to the numbers I'm used to from Oura.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Finally, I added a <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/KJBe8?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Explainers&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Whoop%20band&amp;short_url=KJBe8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Whoop band</a> to the mix. I don&rsquo;t normally wear this (unless I&rsquo;m <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-its-like-to-track-your-recovery-with-the-whoop-str-1846208997\" target=\"_blank\"><u>writing</u></a> <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/should-you-get-a-whoop-band-or-a-smartwatch-1848110715\" target=\"_blank\"><u>about</u></a> <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/is-whoops-new-strength-trainer-worth-switching-for-1850477196\" target=\"_blank\"><u>it</u></a>) and for this experiment I only wore it at night, not during the day.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>I entered each day&rsquo;s resting heart rate and HRV from each device into a spreadsheet. Whoop and Oura each give one number as my nightly HRV; Garmin gives two, an &ldquo;overnight average&rdquo; and a &ldquo;highest 5-min average.&rdquo; So for that device, I tracked both. I wore the Oura and Garmin for about a week before realizing I should add the Whoop to the mix. In total, I wore at least two devices for about a month, with 24 days of data on all three.</p><p>When it comes to <em>using</em> this data, I already have a sense of how the numbers compare to my experience. If my HRV is high and my RHR is low, I pretty much always feel good and am ready to take on whatever the day throws at me. If my HRV is low and my RHR is high, I&rsquo;m either stressed, sick, or maybe didn&rsquo;t sleep enough; I may or may not do an easier workout that day, but I&rsquo;ll definitely pay more attention to taking care of myself and getting plenty of sleep going forward. If my RHR and HRV are <em>both</em> high, that tends to mean I&rsquo;m dealing with a lot of stress or fatigue but am handling it well. For this experiment, I didn&rsquo;t bother tracking data on how I felt; I already know that the Oura data is good at matching how I feel, so the question was whether the other devices tracked the same trends or not.</p><h2>Results</h2><p>It was fascinating to watch the results take shape as I added more data points to the spreadsheet. The raw numbers were often pretty different: my resting heart rate on a given night might be 45, 47, or 50 depending on which device I&rsquo;m reading from. But as I logged weeks&rsquo; worth of data, the trend lines always told the same story:&nbsp;</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J21Z5D4AKNC2KGZ2QNYXNX8X/images-1.fill.size_2000x1321.v1720200639.png\" alt=\"Top: resting HR.

But once you&rsquo;re used to the numbers, any of these devices would do perfectly well at tracking your resting heart rate and letting you notice when it&rsquo;s particularly high or low.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The same pattern is evident in my HRV readings, although the differences between devices are sharper. Whoop and Oura track almost exactly together&mdash;it can be hard to see the light gray line on the chart above because it almost looks like a shadow of the blue line.&nbsp;</p><p>Garmin appears differently, with its average always a bit below Whoop and Oura, and its &ldquo;highest 5-min average&rdquo; often above them. Again, I&rsquo;d feel confident trusting any of these devices, but I wouldn&rsquo;t try to compare between them. If I were to use Oura some nights and the Garmin on others, I might get the wrong impression. But sticking with any one device, you&rsquo;ll get useful numbers.</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>All three of the <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/joxrv?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Explainers&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Oura%20ring&amp;short_url=joxrv&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Oura ring</a> (gen 3), <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/KJBe8?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Explainers&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Whoop%20band%204.0&amp;short_url=KJBe8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Whoop band 4.0</a>, and <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/pg5d4?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Explainers&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Garmin%20Forerunner%20265&amp;short_url=pg5d4&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Garmin Forerunner 265</a> gave consistent, useful readings for both resting heart rate and heart rate variability.

						"__cdata": "<p>Data leaks are an inevitability of the digital age. It's all but impossible to have accounts online without losing <em>some</em> of your passwords to these attacks (<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-two-factor-authentication-in-mac-os-password-app\" target=\"_blank\">which is why using 2FA is so important</a>). But it's one thing to know some of your passwords are out there somewhere; it's another thing entirely to know there are <em>billions </em>of our passwords conveniently rounded up for the taking. </p><p>That's exactly what new research seems to suggest: <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/is-this-the-biggest-password-leak-ever-uncovered-researchers-claim-nearly-10-billion-credentials-under-threat-heres-what-we-know-so-far\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">As reported by TechRadar</a>, researchers say they found a text file, called rockyou2024.txt, containing nearly 10 billion unique passwords, all stored in plain text. That means anyone with access could scrape the list as they would a PDF and discover each and every password for themselves.</p><p>This was not a project that happened overnight: These passwords were collected over time, from various attacks and leaks over the past 20 years. Attackers added 1.5 billion of these passwords to the file from 2021 to this year alone. The fact that these are all unique, too, means there are no repeats in the list. It's tough to wrap your head around that many passwords.</p><h2>What's the danger with these password leaks?</h2><p>While it's bad enough that anyone with the list can Command+F their way into searching for any password under the sun, that's not really where the danger lies. It would simply take too long to look for specific passwords to try.</p><p>Rather, bad actors can use lists like this one to engage in brute force and credential stuffing attacks. In a brute force attack, bad actors try a large number of passwords in quick succession to try to break into an account. Credential stuffing is similar, but involves using leaked credentials&mdash;like known username/password combinations&mdash;with other accounts, as people tend to use the same password for multiple accounts. (Please don't do this.)</p><p>Bad actors don't run these attacks by hand, of course: They use computers, which can try <em>millions</em> of these passwords in an attempt to break into these accounts. With a database of 10 billion unique passwords, hackers will certainly have a field day running brute force and credential stuffing attacks against both individuals and organizations alike.  </p><h2>How to protect yourself from this password database</h2><p>Hopefully, organizations take the time to shore up their defenses against attacks like these, but even as individuals, there's quite a bit we can do to protect ourselves.</p><p>First, you can use a <a href=\"https://cybernews.com/password-leak-check/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">leaked password checker</a> to see if your credentials are available for bad actors to use, whether that's in this database or elsewhere. If you see that any of your passwords have been compromised, change them immediately. </p><p>On that note, make sure you're using a strong and unique password for <em>every single one </em>of your accounts. In the event an account's credentials are leaked, bad actors won't be successful in credential stuffing, as your other accounts won't use that compromised password. </p><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/embrace-the-passwordless-future-of-passkeys-1850418024\" target=\"_blank\">If an account supports passkeys</a>, use that instead, as passkeys have no credentials to leak. If not, use two-factor authentication whenever possible. In the event that bad actors know your credentials, they won't be able to break into your account without access to your trusted device, whether that's a smartphone or an authenticator app.</p><p>To manage all these credentials, <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-password-managers?test_uuid=05GCyCmbxBRLzxn0Zys1DBH&amp;test_variant=a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">use a password manager</a>. Not only will a good password manager help you, um, manage your passwords, it should come with convenient security features, like password generators, 2FA codes, and alerts when your passwords are leaked.  </p>"

						"__cdata": "<p>A good half-sour dill is the answer to many of life&rsquo;s questions, not to mention to dishes that need a little something extra. Usually sandwiches. Pickles come in a handful of shapes&mdash;whole, spears, chips, and flats&mdash;so you can find the one that is the best fit for your meal. And while there&rsquo;s no wrong way to enjoy pickles, there is a better way to optimize your pickle to ensure the best sandwich experience. You need to shave it.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, there&rsquo;s are sandwich-sliced pickles, cut lengthwise so the cucumber can sit flat on a piece of bread. While that works, shaved pickles sit <em>even better</em>. But that&rsquo;s not even why I started shaving my pickles in the first place. I did so because for once, I just wanted a little bit of pickle.</p><p>I was making myself an egg salad sandwich and decided a tiny bit of pickle would be nice. I only buy whole pickles, because then I can change their shape as needed. I tried using a knife to cut the thinnest possible slices, since I was already predicting the slippery minxes might slide out of my sandwich. Frustrated that I wasn&rsquo;t getting thin enough results, I reached for my vegetable peeler.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J21REVAQ2EEP6XKDN1MYGCWZ/images-1.fill.size_2000x1124.v1720193609.jpg\" alt=\"Hands using vegetable peeler to shave a pickle.\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1124\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J21REVAQ2EEP6XKDN1MYGCWZ/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1720193609.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J21REVAQ2EEP6XKDN1MYGCWZ/images-1.fill.size_1400x787.v1720193609.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J21REVAQ2EEP6XKDN1MYGCWZ/images-1.fill.size_2000x1124.v1720193609.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\"></span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The resulting pickle shavings were perfect&mdash;thin, delicate, and ribbon-like. I only wanted a taste of pickle in my sandwich, so I was able to use just a few shaves of the cuke, which you can&rsquo;t do easily with pre-cut slices. The ribbons allowed for good coverage so every bite had a little briny kick, and they didn&rsquo;t slide out as I ate.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to shave your pickles for the thinnest slice</h2><p>For the most leverage, grip one end of the pickle, pressing the other down into your cutting board, then use your other hand to run a vegetable peeler down its length with your other hand. Repeat for as many slices as you want, and return any leftover hunk to the brine. For this task I prefer <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/5MAnY?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Hacks&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=a%20speed%20peeler%2C%20or%20a%20y-peeler&amp;short_url=5MAnY&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>a speed peeler, or a y-peeler</u></a>, because I find the angle is better.&nbsp;</p><h2>The benefits of shaved pickles</h2><p>The real boon of shaving pickles is flexibility. Pickle lovers can put an obscene amount of pickle onto their sandwiches and burgers, and the thin shape can be twisted, folded, and manipulated to sit securely without sliding off the edge. (I've put two pickles worth of shavings onto a sandwich that would normally only hold one.) For folks that aren&rsquo;t quite so in love with pickles, shavings are a great way to add just a touch of flavor: You can add only two or three ribbons to your burger but still get a little pickle in every bite. Furthermore, this shape is really helpful for anyone who can&rsquo;t easily bite through thick, crunchy foods.&nbsp;</p><p>And yes, you do lose some crunch by shaving your pickles, and the thin shape isn&rsquo;t the right choice for every dish. But it&rsquo;s a great pickle shape to be aware of, especially if you&rsquo;ve always wanted to get two or three times the advisable amount of pickles to sit securely on your hoagie.&nbsp;</p>"

The match kicks off <strong>July 5th at 3:00 p.m. ET</strong>. You can catch the match in English on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>BBC iPlayer</u></a> or <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>ITVX</u></a> or in French with <a href=\"https://www.6play.fr/M6/direct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>6play</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.tf1.fr/tf1/direct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>TF1</u></a>. You'll need an Express VPN subscription to bypass the geo-restrictions.</p><h2>England vs. Switzerland</h2><p>England seem to be scraping by the tournament so far with a lot of luck. Their Group C opponents all tied, so England advanced with their only win so far against Slovakia. Switzerland, on the other hand, managed to tie Germany and beat Italy 2 to 0.

The feature is called \"multiple spaces\" (or virtual desktops, in old computer speak), the equivalent of multiple desktops on Windows.</p><p>The idea is you get a series of virtual copies of your main desktop, which can then be used to organize your various apps on. You might have different desktops for different areas of work, for instance, or maybe have one desktop for productivity (Google Docs and Slack) and one desktop for leisure time (Netflix and Instagram).</p><p>It's up to you how you make use of them&mdash;part of the appeal is their flexibility&mdash;but you should certainly be aware of multiple spaces and their potential. </p><h2>Setting up your first space</h2><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J21CRA1GPK3FWDC1JMHSWF3W/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720181336.jpg\" alt=\"macOS Mission Control\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J21CRA1GPK3FWDC1JMHSWF3W/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1720181336.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J21CRA1GPK3FWDC1JMHSWF3W/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1720181336.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J21CRA1GPK3FWDC1JMHSWF3W/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720181336.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\">Mission Control gives you an overview of your programs.</span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Lifehacker</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>To start working with multiple spaces, you need to launch Mission Control, the macOS interface for showing all of your open application windows. You can either tap the dedicated Mission Control button (showing three rectangles, above F3), press <strong>Ctrl+Up arrow</strong>, or swipe up with three fingers on the trackpad.</p><p>Once you're in Mission Control, you'll see all of your desktops at the top&mdash;though to begin with, there will just be the one Desktop heading. Click the <strong>+</strong> (plus) button in the top right corner to create a new desktop space, which will be added to the thumbnails at the top. Click on any of the desktop thumbnails to jump to that space.</p><p>You'll notice that every desktop has the same dock and the same desktop icons, though you can have different programs on each desktop. For apps that allow multiple instances&mdash;such as your web browser, or Finder&mdash;you can run different instances on different desktops. You could have social media websites on one desktop and work sites like Slack and Google Docs open on another, for example.</p><p>Other apps, such as Photoshop, can only run once and on one desktop. If you attempt to launch apps like this a second time, you'll be taken back to the desktop where they're currently running. You can move apps between spaces by dragging them to the edges of the screen, or by dragging then around in Mission Control.</p><p>If you want to, you can specify which desktop a particular app should open up in, by default: Open the program, <strong>Ctrl+click</strong> on its icon in the dock, then choose from the options listed. You can specify a particular screen for an application to open up in as well, if you have more than one display on your Mac.</p><h2>Managing multiple spaces</h2><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J21CRA1GPK3FWDC1JMHSWF3W/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720181336.jpg\" alt=\"macOS Mission Control\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J21CRA1GPK3FWDC1JMHSWF3W/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1720181336.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J21CRA1GPK3FWDC1JMHSWF3W/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1720181336.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J21CRA1GPK3FWDC1JMHSWF3W/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720181336.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\">Mission Control options in System Settings.</span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Lifehacker</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Head to Mission Control whenever you want to jump between spaces. As well as navigating via Mission Control, you can also hold down the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key and tap on the <strong>Left</strong> or <strong>Right arrow</strong> to go left and right between your spaces. Swiping left or right with three fingers on the trackpad does the same job.</p><p>You can't rename desktops to make them easier to identify, but you can set separate backgrounds for each one, which helps when cycling through the various thumbnails. You can set a backdrop on any desktop in the normal way: Right-click on a blank area of the desktop, and choose <strong>Change Wallpaper</strong> from the menu.</p><p>To close down a desktop, right-click on its thumbnail in Mission Control, then click on the <strong>X</strong> icon that appears next to it. Any open apps on the desktop space won't be closed down, so you're not going to lose any work&mdash;instead they get shifted over to the primary desktop where you can find them again.</p><p>There are various options for multiple spaces, which you can find in the Mission Control section under <strong>Desktop &amp; Dock</strong> in <strong>System Settings</strong> on the <strong>Apple</strong> menu. The toggle switches control whether macOS reorders your spaces based on how you use them, uses separate spaces for separate displays (if you have more than one connected), and groups windows for the same application together on the same space.</p><p>We recently featured <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/use-spaceman-keep-track-virtual-desktops\" target=\"_blank\">the Spaceman utility</a> as well, which adds a useful bit of extra functionality to multiple spaces in macOS: It means you can see right on the menu bar which desktop space you're currently in, and even label them with different names.

					"thumbnail": "",
					"encoded": {
						"__cdata": "<p>July is one of my favorite gardening months, because it feels like a pause. All your vegetables are planted and should be on their way to fruiting. The flowers you got in the ground the last two months should have started to bloom, and the weather isn&rsquo;t murderously hot yet. There is lots of harvesting to be done, and fall to start thinking about, but I spend a lot of July just walking around the yard, appreciating what&rsquo;s there.&nbsp;</p><h2>The daily survey</h2><p>I wasn&rsquo;t kidding about taking a daily lap around the garden, which I try to do before the sun is too high in the sky. Each morning, I walk around with my garden hod, and a bucket. Take note of how things are doing and what needs more water or perhaps a fertilizer boost, and look for infestations. If you see a weed, pick it and chuck it into the bucket. If something needs to be harvested, add it to the hod. Top up your water features and bee stations and try to spend a few moments just sitting and appreciating all the hard work over some snap peas or raspberries.&nbsp;</p><h2>Water, water everywhere</h2><p>The headline for this month is dialing in irrigation since it&rsquo;s likely the first time this year you really need it on a consistent basis. As temperatures climb, it&rsquo;s imperative to have consistent water at the root of plants. Test your irrigation or watering systems if you haven&rsquo;t yet and get them turned on. Check in for the first week or two and make sure the ground is getting moist about six inches under the topsoil and adjust the water as necessary. It&rsquo;s never too late to mulch to conserve water and protect plant roots. Remember that you want a nice thick layer of mulch, an inch isn&rsquo;t going to do much. Make sure to pull that mulch away from the stems of your plants.&nbsp;</p><h2>Deadhead to create stronger and more prolific blooms</h2><p>Most of the summer blooming flowers are &ldquo;cut and come again&rdquo; blooms.&nbsp; Cut the flowers and a good stem, and the plant will come back with a stronger, branched stem. Some flowers, like stock, are single bloom (they bloom only once, on one stem, so chop it and it&rsquo;s over). But zinnia, echinacea, and snapdragons thrive from a chop. This means a summer full of cut flowers, but even if you let flowers stay on the plant, be sure to deadhead every day or so.&nbsp;</p><h2>Turn over peas and other spring vegetables</h2><p>At some point around now, your peas will start going brown and crispy from the bottom up. This just means it&rsquo;s time to turn over the space for summer, and hopefully you have some climbing beans or something else to go into the space. Your spinach, boy choy, and spring broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage have all also flowered by now, so those spaces are ready to turn over for summer or fall.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometime this or next month, garlic is going to be ready to come out of the ground, too. Wait for three or four brown leaves and then harvest with a hand spade (do not try to just pull them out of the ground).&nbsp;</p><p>If you got potatoes into the ground in spring, you can start harvesting them as soon as they plants begin to flower. Use a spade to turn over the earth and then use your hands to find all the baby potatoes. You can let really tiny seed potatoes fall back into the bed, which will help it perennialize.&nbsp;</p><h2>Succession plant flowers, lettuce, radish, scallions, beets, kohlrabi and other greens</h2><p>In the newly empty spaces, remember to keep succession planting going. Get seeds in routinely or starts from the nursery. If you go with seeds, you&rsquo;ll need to work harder to keep them hydrated so they germinate, once they&rsquo;re in the ground.&nbsp;</p><h2>Harvest your berries</h2><p>It is berry season, so be sure you&rsquo;re getting all of your berries harvested as they&rsquo;re ready. Raspberries should be coming to an end, with blueberries in full swing. At some point this month, strawberries will be dunzo, which means you can cut them back fully so they can focus on roots for next year instead of runners. I run the lawnmower over them to accomplish this.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fall planting</h2><p>You should have your fall starts started by the end of July, if you&rsquo;re growing from seed. These starts won&rsquo;t go in for a month or two, which gives you enough time to get a tray of seeds going now.</p>"

						"__cdata": "<p>When it comes to protecting your accounts, the general consensus is to use <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/no-one-knows-about-two-factor-authentication-and-privat-1838913065\" target=\"\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"open in a new window\">two-factor authentication</a>, which traditionally uses a unique six-digit code that gets replaced every 30 seconds. If you want to keep hackers away, it&rsquo;s a big help...but the process isn&rsquo;t seamless. You often need a third-party app, and you might lose access to all your passwords if you lose your phone or the app itself.</p><p>With the new Passwords app in iOS 18 (<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/install-ios-18-beta-wwdc\" target=\"_blank\">currently in developer beta</a>), Apple is making the process of singing up for and using 2-factor authentication even simpler. You can set up two-factor natively on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and since it&rsquo;s linked to your iCloud account, it&rsquo;s secure, supports autofill, and you&rsquo;ll never lose access to it. Not to mention, it&rsquo;s free to use.</p><p>Plus, the Passwords app now has a dedicated section for Codes, where all your two-factor codes are listed together. The app also makes it easy to copy and paste codes even for apps that don't support the autofill feature.</p><p>To be clear, this built-in authenticator is different from your Apple ID&rsquo;s two-factor authentication settings. The latter sends a code to one of your trusted Apple devices when trying to log into your Apple ID. This new feature, however, is for third-party services that require an authenticator app.</p><h2>How to set up two-factor authentication in Passwords app</h2><p>To set up two-factor authentication for a website or an app using the new tools in iOS 18, you&rsquo;ll first need to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/install-ios-18-beta-wwdc\" target=\"_blank\">install the iOS 18 beta using the instructions here</a>. Then, you'll need to add two-factor authentication for that site or app to the Passwords app. The steps for doing this are almost the same for all websites and apps, although the wording might differ. </p><p>Navigate to the passwords section in the site or app you're using, then choose its two-factor authentication option. Copy the code that the app or website gives you. Open the Passwords app, then add the code for the login page and authenticate.</p><p>For example, let's set up two-factor authentication for the Instagram app. Open the Instagram app, go to your Profile and tap the Menu button. Here, choose <strong>Accounts Center</strong> &gt; <strong>Password and Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Two-Factor authentication</strong> and choose your Instagram account. </p><p>Choose <strong>Authentication App</strong> as an option, then tap <strong>Next</strong>. Now, the Instagram app will show you a unique key. Tap on the <strong>Copy Key</strong> button to copy it to your clipboard.</p><p>Then, open the Passwords app and find the entry for your Instagram account. Tap the <strong>Edit</strong> button from the top, then choose the <strong>Set Up Code</strong> option.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2HC7GYPVK4ATNRNKB685GG/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720172490.png\" alt=\"Setting up verification code in Instagram.\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2HC7GYPVK4ATNRNKB685GG/images-3.fill.size_800x450.v1720172490.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2HC7GYPVK4ATNRNKB685GG/images-3.fill.size_1400x788.v1720172490.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HF2HC7GYPVK4ATNRNKB685GG/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720172490.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\"></span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Khamosh Pathak</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>From the popup, paste the code key and tap <strong>Use Setup Key</strong>.

But even if you're using a single display, there's a way to expand the space you've got to work with: Virtual desktops.</p><p>Virtual desktops&mdash;or multiple desktops, as they're now officially called&mdash;are basically copies of your main desktop you can jump to with a click or a <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/52-of-the-best-windows-11-keyboard-shortcuts\" target=\"_blank\">keyboard shortcut</a>, each with its own separate set of open windows and apps.

Here's how to get started.</p><h2>Setting up your first virtual desktop in Windows 11</h2><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1YV2ATKV8XJMJC5MYBD9HBW/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720095681.jpg\" alt=\"Windows desktops\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1YV2ATKV8XJMJC5MYBD9HBW/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1720095681.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1YV2ATKV8XJMJC5MYBD9HBW/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1720095681.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1YV2ATKV8XJMJC5MYBD9HBW/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720095681.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\">Virtual desktops let you put your apps in different silos.</span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Lifehacker</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>You can bring up the multiple desktops interface by pressing <strong>Windows+Tab</strong>, or by clicking the Task View button on the taskbar&mdash;it looks like a white square on top of a black one. If the Task View button isn't visible, right-click on the taskbar, choose <strong>Taskbar settings</strong>, then enable the button.</p><p>Once you're in the Task View screen, you'll see your open desktops at the bottom. Click <strong>New desktop</strong> to create a new one to the right of the existing ones&mdash;there doesn't appear to be any limit on the number of desktops you can make, though realistically, you won't need more than a handful.</p><p>You can then click on any desktop thumbnail to jump to that desktop. Note that the desktop icon shortcuts and the pinned taskbar icons remain the same across multiple desktops. What does change are the open windows and the open apps: If you want to use Edge on two desktops, for example, you'll need to launch it separately on each one.</p><p>When it comes to multiple instances of programs and app syncing, each instance runs independently. If you launch Chrome on two separate desktops, Chrome will see it as two separate computers&mdash;your browsing data will still be synced if you've got sync turned on, but you can't jump between all of your tabs like you can when you've got two windows open on the same desktop.</p><p>Some apps don't support two separate instances, while others do: You can open as many File Explorer and web browser windows as you like, for example, but Photoshop will limit you to one. If you can only run one instance of an application in Windows generally, you can only have it open on one of your virtual desktops.</p><h2>How to manage your virtual desktops</h2><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1YV2ATKV8XJMJC5MYBD9HBW/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720095681.jpg\" alt=\"Windows desktops\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1YV2ATKV8XJMJC5MYBD9HBW/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1720095681.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1YV2ATKV8XJMJC5MYBD9HBW/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1720095681.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1YV2ATKV8XJMJC5MYBD9HBW/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720095681.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\">Right-click on a desktop thumbnail for more options.</span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Lifehacker</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Any time you need to get at your virtual desktops, use the same <strong>Windows+Tab</strong> keyboard shortcut, or the Task View button on the taskbar, as described above. You can also hold down <strong>Windows+Ctrl</strong> and tap the <strong>left</strong> or <strong>right arrow</strong> to scroll through your virtual desktops. <strong>Windows+Ctrl+D</strong> creates a new virtual desktop, and jumps straight to it.</p><p>To help you better distinguish between your desktops on the Task View screen, you can set a different wallpaper for each one: Just jump into a desktop, right-click on the desktop itself, then choose <strong>Personalization</strong>. You can also rename desktops by clicking on the name above the thumbnail and typing in something else.</p><p>Right-click on a desktop thumbnail in Task View to get at more options. From the menu that pops up you're able to move desktops to the left or right in the overall order, as well as access the options we've already mentioned: Renaming desktops and changing the background. You can pick <strong>Close desktop</strong> to shut down the desktop and all the apps on it (you can also click the <strong>X</strong> above any desktop thumbnail to do this).</p><p>When you close down a desktop, all of the apps you had open on it will shift to the next desktop to the left&mdash;so you're not in any danger of accidentally losing work while you're closing down your desktops. If you close down all of your desktops except the first one, all of your open apps will pile up on it.</p><p>You can use virtual desktops with multiple monitors, but you can't have different desktops on different screens: When you change to a different virtual desktop, that desktop fills up all of your displays, so you're free to organize the open windows you've got as you see fit (as would be the case if you're just working with one desktop).</p>"

						"__cdata": "<p>July is a great time to reset the seeding station at your house. All the summer starts are in the garden at this point, so you have room to put time and energy into succession plantings, fall starts and perennials. Even better, you don&rsquo;t have to grow the starts inside&mdash;you can use your seed trays outside in the sun. I set up a bank of trays in the driveway, in full sun, and ensure they have a bottom-watering tray (that's a tray filled with water underneath the seed tray so that the soil can always draw whatever water it needs). I use tray domes (the clear plastic dome that sits on top of the seed tray to maintain moisture) sparingly because of the high heat outside. On really hot days I remove the domes, so the seeds don&rsquo;t fry. As soon as there&rsquo;s even the tiniest show of germination, the domes come off permanently.&nbsp;</p><h2>Succession seeding</h2><p>Most years, I get a little cocky this time of year and don&rsquo;t stay on top of my succession planting&mdash;and then regret it. This year I'm starting &ldquo;Succession Saturday,&rdquo; where every week I force myself to get out, evaluate what needs turnover, and make sure I plant a few lettuces, radishes, beets and kohlrabi.</p><h2>Get ready for fall</h2><p>Hopefully, you now have all your fall planting seeds ordered and received and know what you need to plant. July is when you&rsquo;ll want to get these starts going, so that they&rsquo;re ready to get slotted into gardening spots in late August/early September. As your summer plants get cleared out, you&rsquo;ll replace them with fall. Think about your winter hearty vegetables (which, admittedly, is a little tough when it&rsquo;s 100 degrees out)&mdash;cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, root vegetables, etc.&nbsp;</p><h2>Perennials</h2><p>Spend a moment thinking about every expensive perennial you fawn over at the nursery. Unless they're vegetable starts, these plants can really take a tool on your finances. So grow them yourself, either from seeds or from a clipping. If you can find someone with one of these perennials, you can usually grab a healthy clipping, strip the end, dip it in rooting powder and get that little guy into some potting soil. You can also do this to duplicate your own plants. If not, get some seeds and get to work. Instead of paying $30 for a coneflower this summer, grow 10 of them for $5 in seeds. If you start now, you&rsquo;ll have a four-inch pot sized plant by fall.&nbsp;</p>"

A pair of Japanese siblings narrowly escape the American firebombing of Kobe in the final months of World War II, but their struggles continue as they travel a war-torn countryside, with nowhere to live, no money, and no food. It's widely considered one of the saddest films ever made, with a visual palette to match&mdash;the animators used a soft brown as a base, rather than the more traditional black ink, which gives the film a unique and dreamlike visual quality. It's a beautiful and challenging, and inexplicably hard to find. </p><p><strong>How to watch it anyway:</strong> This is a tough one: North American <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/6X0bR?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=DVDs%20and%20Blu-rays&amp;short_url=6X0bR&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">DVDs and Blu-rays</a> are all out of print, and can cost hundreds of dollars from resellers. If you have a region-free player, however, imported versions go for much less.</p><hr><h2><em>Starbooty/Starrbooty</em> (1987/2007)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-2vj3cXkb52k\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s RuPaul&rsquo;s world, and we&rsquo;re just living in it. So how come it&rsquo;s so hard to come by the drag queen supermodel&rsquo;s first film? Made for pretty much no money way back in 1987, the original <em>Starbooty</em> was Ru &amp; co&rsquo;s answer to the blaxploitation era, while the 2007 remake (<em>Starrbooty</em>, with an extra &ldquo;r&rdquo;), released just a couple of years before <em>Drag Race </em>started, covered some of the same territory with slightly larger budget. Neither is readily available, with the original film (technically a trilogy of short films that add up to about an hour) available on DVD from only one website; DVDs of the reboot are entirely out of print.</p><p><strong>How to watch it anyway:</strong> The out-of-print DVDs of the 2007 film go for upward of $50 on eBay and other online sellers. Earlier versions occasionally pop up on YouTube, but they generally don't last long.</p><hr><h2><em>Dogma</em> (1999)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-20CRw3XdETA\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Kevin Smith&rsquo;s masterful satire of organized religion was met with protests upon its release, though that isn&rsquo;t why it&rsquo;s unavailable. Turns out the films rights are personally owned by Bob and Harvey Weinstein, and they don&rsquo;t seem to have any interest in doing anything with them, nor does Smith want to pay Weinstein a dime to get them back.

There, she meets the uninhibited Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), daughter of the editor, and the two form a connection; Sarah is initially repulsed, then fascinated by the younger woman&rsquo;s sexual freedom. The emotional intrigue grows increasingly fraught, until the inevitable murder complicates things even further. The film&rsquo;s sexual content was toned down for its original American release, so the \"unrated\" original French version is the one to look for.</p><p><strong>How to watch it anyway:</strong> The DVDs aren't technically in print, but new and used copies are pretty <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/5MAbj?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=easy%20to%20find%20from%20resellers&amp;short_url=5MAbj&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">easy to find from resellers</a>.

It also introduced the world to Chlo&euml; Sevigny, and yet it&rsquo;s nevertheless hard to come by in 2023.</p><p><strong>How to watch it anyway: </strong>The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/R0K8K?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=out%20of%20print%20DVDs&amp;short_url=R0K8K&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">out of print DVDs</a> go for $15&ndash;20, and there&rsquo;s an all-region European Blu-ray that&rsquo;ll probably set you back around $30.

Yes, it's like four hours long, and yes, it's worth the investment: consistently delightful, with an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink vibe that ensures that it never, ever gets dull, even at such an extended runtime. It&rsquo;s got silly comedy and over-the-top-villains, and enough meat to the story to hold things together. The A. R. Rahman soundtrack is just the icing. Alas: good luck watching it.</p><p><strong>How to watch it anyway:</strong> No official channels, but you can find it on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbX-3eZRzsI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">YouTube</a>, or on <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/AdBVp?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=all-region%20DVD%20import&amp;short_url=AdBVp&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">all-region DVD import</a> (but buyer beware&mdash;there are a lot of sketchy versions for sale out there).</p><hr><h2><em>Sleuth</em> (1972)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-XBRMaieaLdU\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier both received Oscar nominations for this film, two-hander mystery thriller, as did director Joseph L.

It veers from moments of humor to profound sadness, but builds to a climax of extraordinary beauty. Deservedly, the film frequently appears on all-time best lists for animation.

It all gets a little nuts before the end, but Diane Keaton is great.</p><p><strong>How to watch it anyway:</strong> An all-region Australian import that <em>should</em> play on a North American player, will cost around $20.

Those production values alone make the movie worth watching, though, and any movie that teams Elizabeth Taylor, Montgomery Clift (who very nearly died in a car accident during production), Eva Marie Saint, and Lee Marvin is worth a look. If it&rsquo;s not quite a great movie, it&rsquo;s a fascinating failure and a piece of Hollywood history.</p><p><strong>How to watch it anyway:</strong> A 2014 Australian release, widely available at reasonable prices, should play on a North American player.</p><hr><h2><em>Titus</em> (1999)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-OvZRvKf78yY\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Julie Taymor, best known, perhaps, for her lush stage production of <em>The Lion King</em>, had her motion picture directorial debut with this similarly stylish Shakespeare adaptation that veers between camp and tragedy with surprising adeptness.

Based on the novel of the same name by Brian Aldiss (who also wrote the story that inspired Spielberg&rsquo;s <em>A.I.</em>) it brought co-writer Roger Corman back to the director&rsquo;s chair after two decades, and remains his last (or, at least, most recent) effort. John Hurt, Raul Julia, Bridget Fonda, and Jason Patric star in a story about a scientist (Hurt) of the future working on a weapon so destructive that, he hopes, it will end all war. As happens with these things, it instead sends him int the past...where he meets a certain Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Julia), himself working on a slightly ill-conceived project.</p><p><strong>How to watch it anyway:</strong> An decent copy of the out-of-print <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/vdox2?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=2006%20DVD&amp;short_url=vdox2&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">2006 DVD</a> release will set you back $20-30.

Reportedly producer Samuel Goldwyn only had the rights to the underlying story and music for 15 years, after which point the distributor would have to renegotiate a deal with the estate of producer George Gershwin. But Gershwin reportedly hated the movie, which didn&rsquo;t make enough of a splash to justify the extra expense. Still, the cast alone is enough to make you wish you could see it for yourself: Sidney Poitier, Dorothy Dandridge, Sammy Davis, Jr., Pearl Bailey, Diahann Carroll, Brock Peters, Nichelle Nichols, &mdash;these are some of the most talented, iconic entertainers of the 20th century, and it&rsquo;s a shame that we can&rsquo;t easily see them gathered on screen together.</p><p><strong>How to watch it anyway:</strong> Copies of an all-region DVD <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/8BWbw?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=release%20from%202002&amp;short_url=8BWbw&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">release from 2002</a> run to $100 or more; a more recent release from <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/PyBpO?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Crescent%20Media&amp;short_url=PyBpO&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Crescent Media</a> is cheaper, but the quality is pretty poor.

It's a weird and overblown sexual fantasy involving a young woman of mixed heritage experiencing lust and prejudice, but that hectic jumbling of plot elements is a big part of what makes it fun.

						"__cdata": "<p>You really should be <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/no-one-knows-about-two-factor-authentication-and-privat-1838913065\" target=\"\">using two-factor authentication</a> for all your important accounts. An extra layer of added security, with a six-digit passcode that&rsquo;s regenerated every 30 seconds, is essential for keeping your digital accounts safe and secure. But the question is, how do you go about it in a way that&rsquo;s actually easy to use?&nbsp;</p><p>Options are aplenty&mdash;Bitwarden and 1Password both have stellar two-factor authentication features built-in&mdash;but these apps cost money, and they&rsquo;re ultimately third-party options, rather than something built into our devices. The new Passwords app in macOS Sequoia offers a one-stop shop to manage all your passwords. Plus, now there's a dedicated section that shows all the two-factor codes together, just like a third-party app like 1Password. This will make it easier to use two-factor codes even if you aren't using the Safari app.</p><p>This feature syncs across all your devices using iCloud, so all the two-factor codes from your iPhone will be available on your Mac, and vice versa. (Here&rsquo;s how to use <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-use-your-iphones-new-built-in-two-factor-aut-1847721186\" target=\"\">the two-factor process for iPhone and iPad</a>.) And if you use Safari, you can enter two-factor authentication codes simply by using Touch ID, with no need to dig into a password management app.</p><h2>How to set up two-factor authentication on Mac</h2><p>Setting up two-factor authentication on macOS is easy&mdash;you can scan a QR code for an automatic setup, or enter a code manually, and you&rsquo;re good to go. The process for most websites, apps, and services is the same. In this example, I'll be using a Microsoft account in the Safari browser. You&rsquo;ll need to first add the website login to the Passwords app (save it to iCloud).</p><p>Note that, at time of writing, you'll need to install the macOS Sequoia beta to use this feature. It's best to do this on a backup machine if possible, as using a beta risks instability. To install the beta, open <strong>System Settings</strong>, then navigate to <strong>General &gt; Software Update</strong>. Finally, click <strong>Beta Updates</strong> and select the macOS Sequoia developer beta.</p><p>To begin, open the website, and find the two-factor authentication feature in settings. In your Microsoft Account, go to <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage how I sign in</strong> &gt; <strong>Enter a code from an authenticator app</strong> to get started.</p><p>You'll see a new page for setting up the authenticator app. This will be similar no matter which service you're using. The default option will be to scan a QR code for automatic setup. Don't worry&mdash;you don't need to use a camera to scan this QR code. This feature is used as an express setup, to automatically link your account to the Passwords app. If you want to do it manually, you'll also find an option that says, \"<strong>I can't scan the bar code.</strong>\" This will give you a numeric code that you can enter in the login page in the Passwords app.</p><p>In this case, I'm focusing on the QR-code setup.

We&rsquo;ll share some clues, tips, and strategies, and finally the solution. Today&rsquo;s puzzle is easier; I got it in three. <strong>Beware, there are spoilers below for July 5, Wordle #1,112!</strong> Keep scrolling if you want some hints (and then the answer) to today&rsquo;s Wordle game.</p><h2>How to play Wordle</h2><p>Wordle lives <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>here on the New York Times website</u></a>. A new puzzle goes live every day at midnight, your local time.</p><p>Start by guessing a five-letter word. The letters of the word will turn green if they&rsquo;re correct, yellow if you have the right letter in the wrong place, or gray if the letter isn&rsquo;t in the day&rsquo;s secret word at all. For more, check out <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-master-or-cheat-at-wordle-the-internets-favor-1848312354\" target=\"_blank\"><u>our guide to playing Wordle here</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-lost-wordle-today-1850348061\" target=\"_blank\"><u>my strategy guide here for more advanced tips</u></a>. (We also have more information at the bottom of this post, after the hints and answers.)</p><p>Ready for the hints? Let&rsquo;s go!</p><hr><h2>Does today&rsquo;s Wordle have any unusual letters?</h2><p>We&rsquo;ll define common letters as those that appear in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etaoin_shrdlu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>old typesetters&rsquo; phrase</u></a> ETAOIN SHRDLU. (Memorize this! Pronounce it &ldquo;Edwin Shirdloo,&rdquo; like a name, and pretend he&rsquo;s a friend of yours.)</p><p>Four of today's letters are from our mnemonic. The other is also pretty common.</p><h2>Can you give me a hint for today&rsquo;s Wordle?</h2><p>As a noun, something you have as a teenager; as a verb, to squeeze or press. </p><h2>Does today&rsquo;s Wordle have any double or repeated letters?</h2><p>There are no repeated letters today.&nbsp;</p><h2>How many vowels are in today&rsquo;s Wordle?</h2><p>There is one vowel. </p><h2>What letter does today&rsquo;s Wordle start with?</h2><p>Today&rsquo;s word starts with C.&nbsp;</p><h2>What letter does today&rsquo;s Wordle end with?</h2><p>Today&rsquo;s word ends with H.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is the solution to today&rsquo;s Wordle?</h2><p>Ready? Today&rsquo;s word is CRUSH.</p><h2>How I solved today&rsquo;s Wordle</h2><p>I started with RAISE and TOUCH, which gave me all of the information I needed to guess CRUSH.        </p><pre class=\"border-2 border-gray-400 bg-gray-100 p-4 text-black shadow-md\">Wordle 1,112 3/6\n\n&#129000;&#11035;&#11035;&#129001;&#11035;\n&#11035;&#11035;&#129001;&#129000;&#129001;\n&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;</pre>\n<hr><h2>Yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle answer</h2><p>Yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle was easier. The hint was &ldquo;a first appearance&rdquo; and the answer contained four common letters and one fairly common letter. </p><p>The answer to yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle was DEBUT. </p><h2>A primer on Wordle basics</h2><p>The idea of Wordle is to guess the day&rsquo;s secret word. When you first open the Wordle game, you&rsquo;ll see an empty grid of letters. It&rsquo;s up to <em>you</em> to make the first move: type in any five-letter word.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, you can use the colors that are revealed to get clues about the word:&nbsp;<strong>Green</strong> means you correctly guessed a letter, and it&rsquo;s in the correct position. (For example, if you guess PARTY, and the word is actually PURSE, the P and R will be green.)</p><ul><li><p><strong>Yellow</strong> means the letter is somewhere in the word, but not in the position you guessed it. (For example, if you guessed PARTY, but the word is actually ROAST, the R, A and T will all be yellow.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Gray</strong> means the letter is not in the solution word at all. (If you guessed PARTY and everything is gray, then the solution <em>cannot</em> be PURSE or ROAST.)</p></li></ul><p>With all that in mind, guess another word, and then another, trying to land on the correct word before you run out of chances. You get six guesses, and then it&rsquo;s game over.</p><h2>The best starter words for Wordle</h2><p>What should you play for that first guess? The best starters tend to contain common letters, to increase the chances of getting yellow and green squares to guide your guessing. (And if you get all grays when guessing common letters, that&rsquo;s <em>still</em> excellent information to help you rule out possibilities.) There isn&rsquo;t a single &ldquo;best&rdquo; starting word, but the New York Times&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/this-bot-can-tell-you-how-good-you-really-are-at-wordle-1848769075\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Wordle analysis bot</u></a> has suggested starting with one of these:</p><ul><li><p>CRANE</p></li><li><p>TRACE</p></li><li><p>SLANT</p></li><li><p>CRATE</p></li><li><p>CARTE</p></li></ul><p>Meanwhile, an MIT analysis <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/science-thinks-it-has-found-the-best-wordle-starter-1849541276\" target=\"_blank\"><u>found</u></a> that you&rsquo;ll eliminate the most possibilities in the first round by starting with one of these:</p><ul><li><p>SALET</p></li><li><p>REAST</p></li><li><p>TRACE</p></li><li><p>CRATE</p></li><li><p>SLATE</p></li></ul><p>Other good picks might be ARISE or ROUND. Words like ADIEU and AUDIO get more vowels in play, but you could argue that it&rsquo;s better to start with an emphasis on consonants, using a starter like RENTS or CLAMP. Choose your strategy, and see how it plays out.</p><h2>How to win at Wordle</h2><p>We have a few guides to Wordle strategy, which you might like to read over if you&rsquo;re a serious student of the game. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-win-at-wordle-according-to-my-wife-1848480285\" target=\"_blank\"><u>This one</u></a> covers how to use consonants to your advantage, while <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-master-or-cheat-at-wordle-the-internets-favor-1848312354\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this one</u></a> focuses on a strategy that uses the most common letters. In <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-try-quordle-if-youre-too-good-at-wordle-1848540319\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this advanced guide</u></a>, we detail a three-pronged approach for fishing for hints while maximizing your chances of winning quickly.</p><p>The biggest thing that separates Wordle winners from Wordle losers is that winners <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-lost-wordle-today-1850348061\" target=\"_blank\"><u>use their guesses to gather information about what letters are in the word</u></a>. If you know that the word must end in -OUND, don&rsquo;t waste four guesses on MOUND, ROUND, SOUND, and HOUND; combine those consonants and guess MARSH. If the H lights up in yellow, you know the solution.</p><p>One more note on strategy: the original Wordle used a list of about 2,300 solution words, but after the game was bought by the NYT, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/wordle-has-themes-now-so-you-should-change-your-strate-1849840529\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the game now has an editor who hand-picks the solutions</u></a>. Sometimes they are slightly tricky words that wouldn&rsquo;t have made the original list, and sometimes they are topical. For example, FEAST was the solution one Thanksgiving. So keep in mind that there may be a theme.</p><h2>Wordle alternatives</h2><p>If you can&rsquo;t get enough of five-letter guessing games and their kin, the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-10-best-wordle-alternatives-ranked-by-difficulty-1848859009\" target=\"_blank\"><u>best Wordle alternatives</u></a>, ranked by difficulty, include:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://wheelsrpgs.itch.io/wheeldle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Wheeldle, which lets you play one puzzle after another</u></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://zaratustra.itch.io/dordle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Dordle</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/games/quordle/#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Quordle</u></a>, which ask you to play two (Dordle) or four (Quordle) puzzles at the same time, with the same guesses.

Yes, you might not be physically in Italy, but that's where a VPN comes into play. <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Odoej?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=How-To&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Express%20VPN&amp;short_url=Odoej&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Express VPN</u></a> is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-paid-vpn-services\" target=\"_blank\"><u>our favorite VPN </u></a>for bypassing geo-blocking restrictions.

We&rsquo;ll share some clues, tips, and strategies, and finally the solution. Today&rsquo;s puzzle is easier; I got it in four. <strong>Beware, there are spoilers below for July 4, Wordle #1,111!</strong> Keep scrolling if you want some hints (and then the answer) to today&rsquo;s Wordle game.</p><h2>How to play Wordle</h2><p>Wordle lives <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>here on the New York Times website</u></a>. A new puzzle goes live every day at midnight, your local time.</p><p>Start by guessing a five-letter word. The letters of the word will turn green if they&rsquo;re correct, yellow if you have the right letter in the wrong place, or gray if the letter isn&rsquo;t in the day&rsquo;s secret word at all. For more, check out <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-master-or-cheat-at-wordle-the-internets-favor-1848312354\" target=\"_blank\"><u>our guide to playing Wordle here</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-lost-wordle-today-1850348061\" target=\"_blank\"><u>my strategy guide here for more advanced tips</u></a>. (We also have more information at the bottom of this post, after the hints and answers.)</p><p>Ready for the hints? Let&rsquo;s go!</p><hr><h2>Does today&rsquo;s Wordle have any unusual letters?</h2><p>We&rsquo;ll define common letters as those that appear in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etaoin_shrdlu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>old typesetters&rsquo; phrase</u></a> ETAOIN SHRDLU. (Memorize this! Pronounce it &ldquo;Edwin Shirdloo,&rdquo; like a name, and pretend he&rsquo;s a friend of yours.)</p><p>Four of today's letters are from our mnemonic. The other is fairly common.</p><h2>Can you give me a hint for today&rsquo;s Wordle?</h2><p>A first appearance.</p><h2>Does today&rsquo;s Wordle have any double or repeated letters?</h2><p>There are no repeated letters today.&nbsp;</p><h2>How many vowels are in today&rsquo;s Wordle?</h2><p>There are two vowels. </p><h2>What letter does today&rsquo;s Wordle start with?</h2><p>Today&rsquo;s word starts with D.&nbsp;</p><h2>What letter does today&rsquo;s Wordle end with?</h2><p>Today&rsquo;s word ends with T.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is the solution to today&rsquo;s Wordle?</h2><p>Ready? Today&rsquo;s word is DEBUT.</p><h2>How I solved today&rsquo;s Wordle</h2><p>I started with RAISE and TOUCH, then tried AMEND, as options included the consonants M, D, and N. This left only three possible solutions (DUVET, DEBUT, and ETUDE), of which DEBUT seemed like the most common word.        </p><pre class=\"border-2 border-gray-400 bg-gray-100 p-4 text-black shadow-md\">Wordle 1,111 4/6\n\n&#11035;&#11035;&#11035;&#11035;&#129000;\n&#129000;&#11035;&#129000;&#11035;&#11035;\n&#11035;&#11035;&#129000;&#11035;&#129000;\n&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;</pre>\n<hr><h2>Yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle answer</h2><p>Yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle was easier. The hint was &ldquo;this is a lower body part, colloquially&rdquo; and the answer contained four common letters and one fairly common letter. </p><p>The answer to yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle was THIGH. </p><h2>A primer on Wordle basics</h2><p>The idea of Wordle is to guess the day&rsquo;s secret word. When you first open the Wordle game, you&rsquo;ll see an empty grid of letters. It&rsquo;s up to <em>you</em> to make the first move: type in any five-letter word.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, you can use the colors that are revealed to get clues about the word:&nbsp;<strong>Green</strong> means you correctly guessed a letter, and it&rsquo;s in the correct position. (For example, if you guess PARTY, and the word is actually PURSE, the P and R will be green.)</p><ul><li><p><strong>Yellow</strong> means the letter is somewhere in the word, but not in the position you guessed it. (For example, if you guessed PARTY, but the word is actually ROAST, the R, A and T will all be yellow.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Gray</strong> means the letter is not in the solution word at all. (If you guessed PARTY and everything is gray, then the solution <em>cannot</em> be PURSE or ROAST.)</p></li></ul><p>With all that in mind, guess another word, and then another, trying to land on the correct word before you run out of chances. You get six guesses, and then it&rsquo;s game over.</p><h2>The best starter words for Wordle</h2><p>What should you play for that first guess? The best starters tend to contain common letters, to increase the chances of getting yellow and green squares to guide your guessing. (And if you get all grays when guessing common letters, that&rsquo;s <em>still</em> excellent information to help you rule out possibilities.) There isn&rsquo;t a single &ldquo;best&rdquo; starting word, but the New York Times&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/this-bot-can-tell-you-how-good-you-really-are-at-wordle-1848769075\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Wordle analysis bot</u></a> has suggested starting with one of these:</p><ul><li><p>CRANE</p></li><li><p>TRACE</p></li><li><p>SLANT</p></li><li><p>CRATE</p></li><li><p>CARTE</p></li></ul><p>Meanwhile, an MIT analysis <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/science-thinks-it-has-found-the-best-wordle-starter-1849541276\" target=\"_blank\"><u>found</u></a> that you&rsquo;ll eliminate the most possibilities in the first round by starting with one of these:</p><ul><li><p>SALET</p></li><li><p>REAST</p></li><li><p>TRACE</p></li><li><p>CRATE</p></li><li><p>SLATE</p></li></ul><p>Other good picks might be ARISE or ROUND. Words like ADIEU and AUDIO get more vowels in play, but you could argue that it&rsquo;s better to start with an emphasis on consonants, using a starter like RENTS or CLAMP. Choose your strategy, and see how it plays out.</p><h2>How to win at Wordle</h2><p>We have a few guides to Wordle strategy, which you might like to read over if you&rsquo;re a serious student of the game. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-win-at-wordle-according-to-my-wife-1848480285\" target=\"_blank\"><u>This one</u></a> covers how to use consonants to your advantage, while <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-master-or-cheat-at-wordle-the-internets-favor-1848312354\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this one</u></a> focuses on a strategy that uses the most common letters. In <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-try-quordle-if-youre-too-good-at-wordle-1848540319\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this advanced guide</u></a>, we detail a three-pronged approach for fishing for hints while maximizing your chances of winning quickly.</p><p>The biggest thing that separates Wordle winners from Wordle losers is that winners <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-lost-wordle-today-1850348061\" target=\"_blank\"><u>use their guesses to gather information about what letters are in the word</u></a>. If you know that the word must end in -OUND, don&rsquo;t waste four guesses on MOUND, ROUND, SOUND, and HOUND; combine those consonants and guess MARSH. If the H lights up in yellow, you know the solution.</p><p>One more note on strategy: the original Wordle used a list of about 2,300 solution words, but after the game was bought by the NYT, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/wordle-has-themes-now-so-you-should-change-your-strate-1849840529\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the game now has an editor who hand-picks the solutions</u></a>. Sometimes they are slightly tricky words that wouldn&rsquo;t have made the original list, and sometimes they are topical. For example, FEAST was the solution one Thanksgiving. So keep in mind that there may be a theme.</p><h2>Wordle alternatives</h2><p>If you can&rsquo;t get enough of five-letter guessing games and their kin, the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-10-best-wordle-alternatives-ranked-by-difficulty-1848859009\" target=\"_blank\"><u>best Wordle alternatives</u></a>, ranked by difficulty, include:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://wheelsrpgs.itch.io/wheeldle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Wheeldle, which lets you play one puzzle after another</u></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://zaratustra.itch.io/dordle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Dordle</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/games/quordle/#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Quordle</u></a>, which ask you to play two (Dordle) or four (Quordle) puzzles at the same time, with the same guesses. There is also <a href=\"https://octordle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Octordle</u></a>, with eight puzzles, and <a href=\"https://www.sedecordle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Sedecordle</u></a>, with 16.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://wafflegame.net/daily\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Waffle</u></a>, which <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/waffle-is-the-new-wordle-1848793653\" target=\"_blank\"><u>shows you several five-letter words, scrambled in a grid</u></a>; you play by swapping the letters around until you solve.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://qntm.org/files/absurdle/absurdle.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Absurdle</u></a>, which <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/try-this-game-if-youre-already-too-good-at-wordle-1848356298\" target=\"_blank\"><u>changes the solution after each guess</u></a>, but needs to stay consistent with its previous feedback. You have to strategically back it into a corner until there is only one possible word left; then you guess it, and win.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/squabble-lets-you-beat-other-people-at-wordle-in-real-t-1848849342\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Squabble</u></a>, in which you <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/squabble-lets-you-beat-other-people-at-wordle-in-real-t-1848849342\" target=\"_blank\"><u>play Wordle against other people with a timer running</u></a>.

You&rsquo;re required to reuse any letters that you (oops) guessed correctly, so the longer it takes you, the better you are at the game.</p></li></ul>"

						"__cdata": "<p>I write for a living, which means I reflexively spend a good chunk of my day trying to avoid writing. Computers are perfect for this: I have quick access to every distraction you can possibly dream of, all on the device I should in theory be using to write.</p><p>Perhaps the best part of this whole arrangement is how easy it is to feel guilty about all of the writing I'm not doing. The best tool for this is the screen time feature offered on <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/108806\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/android/answer/9346420?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Android</a> devices, which allow you to review how much time you've spent using each app on your device. These are perfect applications for feeling guilty in a way that doesn't really inspire any kind of self reflection or change: they just make me feel bad.</p><p>And you know what? I think me feeling guilty, and not doing anything about it, is on some level the reason these apps are built into phone operating systems. Such features subtly push the blame away from the intentionally addictive and habit forming applications I use and toward me.</p><p>To make this argument, I'm going to talk about littering. Please don't leave.</p><h2>Pay no attention to the multinationals behind the curtain</h2><p>Littering is obviously bad&mdash;I'm not going to pretend that it isn't. But a lot of the anti-littering messaging you've seen is funded by the companies that produce the wasteful packaging that ends up on the ground. Put simply: there wouldn't be as much litter if regulations forced companies not to over-package everything, but that would cut into profits. Anti-littering campaigns were a specific corporate tactic to prevent regulation. Here's Bradford Plumer, <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2006/05/origins-anti-litter-campaigns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">writing for <em>Mother Jones</em></a>:</p><blockquote><p>In 1953, the packaging industry&mdash;led by American Can Company and Owens-Illinois Glass Company, inventors of the one-way can and bottle, respectively&mdash;joined up with other industry leaders, including Coca-Cola and the Dixie Cup Company to form&nbsp;Keep America Beautiful&nbsp;(KAB), which still exists today. KAB was well-funded and started a massive media campaign to rail against bad environmental habits on the part of&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;rather than businesses.</p></blockquote><p>This isn't a conspiracy theory&mdash;everyone involved was fairly transparent about their motivations, as Plumer's reporting makes plain. I am not saying that all the people who work for Keep America Beautiful are cynical&mdash;I'm sure some sincerely want to reduce litter, and reducing litter is good. But what I am saying is that there is value, for companies, in shifting the blame for litter away from wasteful packaging practices and toward individuals, and that value is the main reasons such large companies are diverting money to such a tactic.</p><p>I think the screen time feature on your phone is similar. I am certain that there are people inside both Apple and Google who are sincerely concerned about users' phone habits, and that screen time features exist in part out of those sincere concerns. At the same time, though, this feature plays a trick similar to the anti-littering campaign: to subtly switch the blame for how much time we all spend on our phones away from the tech industry and toward the individual.</p><h2>It's not about the time, it's about what you do with it</h2><p>Companies like Google, TikTok, and Facebook employ some of the smartest people on the planet and incentivize them to build software that gets users to spend as much time as possible using their products. Using self control to limit your screen time in that context isn't bringing a knife to a gun fight&mdash;it's bringing a water pistol to a thermonuclear war. Tech companies know this&mdash;believe me, they obsess over user data more than you could possibly imagine, and they know that screen time as a tool can, at best, help you aim that water pistol a little better.</p><p>Put simply: if knowing how much time you looked at your screen really helped you waste less time on your devices, the feature wouldn't exist. I think that there needs to be more regulations around the kinds of tactics applications use to pull us into scrolling trances, though I don't think that's likely to happen anytime soon.</p><p>I recently read <a href=\"https://simone.org/tracking-screen-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">an article on </a><a href=\"http://Simone.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Simone.org</a> that outlined this all well, in much fewer words than I've used here:</p><blockquote><p>Here&rsquo;s the truth: Screen time doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s not about how much you use your phone. It&rsquo;s about whether your phone is a needy, attention-sucking vampire. If that&rsquo;s the case, the only healthy screen time is no screen time. Zero. That&rsquo;s why the main metric tracked by screen time apps is deceptive: 10 minutes of shooting crack cocaine intravenously are still 10 minutes of shooting crack cocaine intravenously.</p></blockquote><p>I am not going to sit here and tell you which applications are good and which applications are bad&mdash;only you can figure that out for yourself. And I'm not going to try to tell you how you should use your device&mdash;again, that's on you.</p><p>What I am going to do is tell you that there's value to thinking critically about how you're using your technology. Devices are, in theory, a tool. When you use them it should be toward accomplishing a specific goal. That might be writing, an art project, or coding. It also might be relaxing. It is valuable, no matter what your goal is, to be intentional about it. Your attention is valuable&mdash;what you do with it literally shapes the person you become.</p><p>My advice is to think less about how much time you're spending on your devices and to think more about what you're doing during that time. Two hours spent scrolling through Reddit posts is different than two hours spent reading an ebook. I can go even further: two hours spent scrolling r/all on Reddit is different than two hours spent reading Reddit reviews of a tool you're thinking of buying. The important thing isn't how much time your spend on the device&mdash;it's about noticing, at any given moment, whether the time you're currently spending is being spent well.</p><p>Believe me: this is going to be an annoying habit to build, and in many ways the task is impossible. But your relationship with technology, like any other relationship, is complicated, and you need to work on it regularly if you want it to be healthy. Keep that in mind, and consider turning off screen time notifications altogether.</p>"

					"title": "It’s Time to Learn What ‘Core Sleep’ Actually Is",
					"guid": "01HRFAN0BXFKGGM0DVG583AYZZ",
					"pubDate": "Wed, 03 Jul 2024 21:30:00 +0000",
					"description": "Sleep scientists have one meaning for this term; the Apple Watch has another.",
					"thumbnail": "",
					"encoded": {
						"__cdata": "<p>Friends, let's talk about one of the most confusing terms you&rsquo;ll see on your fitness tracker&mdash;specifically your Apple Watch. Next to REM sleep, which you&rsquo;ve probably heard of, and &ldquo;deep&rdquo; sleep, which feels self explanatory, there&rsquo;s &ldquo;core&rdquo; sleep. And if you google what core sleep means, you&rsquo;ll get a definition that is <em>entirely opposite</em> from how Apple uses the term. So let&rsquo;s break it down.</p><p>The root of the confusion lies in the fact that the term &ldquo;core sleep&rdquo; has been used in the scientific literature to mean a few different things. Importantly, it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> a recognized sleep stage. Apple, on the other hand, decided to rename the sleep stages its watch can detect, and called one of them &ldquo;core sleep&rdquo;&mdash;but it bears no relation to<em> any</em> of the previous common uses of the term.</p><h2>\"Core sleep\" in the Apple Watch is the same as light sleep</h2><p>Let me give you a straightforward explanation of what you&rsquo;re seeing when you look at your Apple sleep data.&nbsp;</p><p>Your Apple Watch tries to guess, mainly through your movements, when you&rsquo;re in each stage of sleep. (To truly know your sleep stages would require a sleep study with more sophisticated equipment, like an electroencephalogram. The watch is just doing its best with the data it has.)&nbsp;</p><p>Apple says their watch can tell the difference between four different states:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Awake</p></li><li><p>Light (&ldquo;core&rdquo;) sleep</p></li><li><p>Deep sleep</p></li><li><p>REM sleep</p></li></ul><p>These categories roughly correspond to the sleep stages that neuroscientists can observe with polysomnography, which involves hooking you up to an electroencephalogram, or EEG. (That&rsquo;s the thing where they attach wires to your head). Scientists recognize three stages of non-REM sleep, with the third being described as deep sleep. That means stages 1 and 2, which are sometimes called &ldquo;light&rdquo; sleep, are being labeled as &ldquo;core&rdquo; sleep by your wearable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In other words: Apple's definition of \"core sleep\" is identical to scientists' definition of \"light sleep.\" It is otherwise known as N2 sleep. (More on that in a minute.)</p><p>So why didn&rsquo;t Apple use the same wording as everyone else? The company says <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/healthcare/docs/site/Estimating_Sleep_Stages_from_Apple_Watch_Sept_2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>in a document on their sleep stage algorithm</u></a> that they were worried people would misunderstand the term \"light sleep\" if they called it that.</p><blockquote><p>The label Core was chosen to avoid possible unintended implications of the term light, because the N2 stage is predominant (often making up more than 50 percent of a night&rsquo;s sleep), normal, and an important aspect of sleep physiology, containing sleep spindles and K-complexes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>In other words, they thought we might assume that \"light\" sleep is less important than \"deep\" sleep, so they chose a new, important-sounding name to use in place of \"light.\" </p><p>A chart on the same page lays it out: non-REM stages 1 and 2 fall under the Apple category of &ldquo;core&rdquo; sleep, while stage 3 is &ldquo;deep&rdquo; sleep. That&rsquo;s how Apple defined it in testing: If an EEG said a person was in stage 2 when the watch said they were in &ldquo;core,&rdquo; that was counted as a success for the algorithm.</p><h2>What are the known sleep stages?</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s back up to consider what was known about sleep stages <em>before</em> Apple started renaming them. The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>current scientific understanding</u></a>, which is based on brain wave patterns that can be read with an EEG, includes these stages:&nbsp;</p><h3>Non-REM stage 1 (N1)&nbsp;</h3><p>N1 only lasts a few minutes. You&rsquo;re breathing normally. Your body is beginning to relax, and your brain waves start to look different than they do when you&rsquo;re awake. This would be considered part of your &ldquo;light&rdquo; sleep.</p><h3>Non-REM stage 2 (N2)</h3><p>Also usually considered &ldquo;light&rdquo; sleep, N2 makes up about half of your sleep time. This stage includes spikes of brain activity called sleep spindles, and distinctive brainwave patterns called <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557469/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>K complexes</u></a>. (These are what the Apple document mentioned above.) This stage of sleep is thought to be when we consolidate our memories. Fun fact: if you grind your teeth in your sleep, it will mostly be in this stage.&nbsp;</p><h3>Non-REM stage 3 (N3)&nbsp;</h3><p>N3 is often called &ldquo;deep&rdquo; sleep, and this stage accounts for about a quarter of your night. It has the slowest brain waves, so it&rsquo;s sometimes called &ldquo;slow wave sleep.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s hard to wake someone up from this stage, and if you succeed, they&rsquo;ll be groggy for a little while afterward. This is the stage where the most body repair tends to happen, including muscle recovery, bone growth in children, and immune system strengthening. As we age, we spend less time in N3 and more time in N2.</p><p>(There was an older classification that split off the deepest sleep into its own stage, calling it non-REM stage 4, but currently that deepest portion is just considered part of stage 3.)&nbsp;</p><h3>REM sleep</h3><p>REM sleep is so named because this is where we have Rapid Eye Movement. Your body is temporarily paralyzed, except for the eyes and your breathing muscles. This is the stage best known for dreaming (although dreams can occur in other stages as well).</p><p>The brain waves of a person in REM sleep look very similar to those of a person who is awake, which is why some sleep-tracking apps show blocks of REM as occurring near the top of the graph, near wakefulness. We don&rsquo;t usually enter REM sleep until we&rsquo;ve been through the other stages, and we cycle through these stages all night. Usually REM sleep is fairly short during the beginning of the night, and gets longer with each cycle.&nbsp;</p><h2>How much core sleep do I need? </h2><p>Using Apple's definition, in which core sleep is the same as light sleep, it's normal for almost half of your sleep to be core sleep. Sleep scientists give an approximate breakdown (although the exact numbers may vary from person to person, and your needs aren't always the same every night):</p><ul><li><p><strong>N1 (very light sleep):</strong> About 5% of the total (just a few minutes)</p></li><li><p><strong>N2 (light or \"core\" sleep):</strong> About 45%, so just under four hours if you normally sleep for eight hours</p></li><li><p><strong>N3 (deep sleep):</strong> About 25%, so about two hours if you normally sleep for eight hours</p></li><li><p><strong>REM:</strong> About 25%, so also about two hours.</p></li></ul><h2>Other ways people use the term &ldquo;core sleep&rdquo;</h2><p>I really wish Apple had chosen another term, because the phrase &ldquo;core sleep&rdquo; has been used in other ways. It either doesn&rsquo;t refer to a sleep stage at all, or if it is associated with sleep stages, it&rsquo;s used to refer to <em>deep</em> sleep stages.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1980&rsquo;s, sleep scientist James Horne proposed that your first few sleep cycles (taking up maybe the first five hours of the night) constitute the &ldquo;core&rdquo; sleep we all need to function. The rest of the night is &ldquo;optional&rdquo; sleep, which ideally we&rsquo;d still get every night, but which it&rsquo;s not a big deal to miss out on from time to time. He described this in a 1988 book called <em>Why We Sleep </em>(no relation to the 2017 book by another author) but you can see <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3909914/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>his earlier paper on the topic here</u></a>. He uses the terms &ldquo;obligatory&rdquo; and &ldquo;facultative&rdquo; sleep in that paper, and switched to the core/optional terminology later.&nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;ll also find people using the phrase &ldquo;core sleep&rdquo; to refer to everything <em>but</em> light sleep. For example, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/000632239290114F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>this paper on how sleep changes as we age</u></a> compares their findings in terms of sleep stages with Horne&rsquo;s definition of core sleep. In doing so, they describe core sleep as mainly consisting of stages N3-N4 (in other words, N3 as described above).&nbsp;</p><p>From there, somehow the internet has gotten the idea that N3 <em>and </em>REM are considered &ldquo;core&rdquo; sleep. I don&rsquo;t know how that happened, and I don&rsquo;t see it when I search the scientific literature. I <em>do</em> see it on &ldquo;what is core sleep?&rdquo; junk articles on the websites of companies selling weighted blankets and melatonin gummies.&nbsp;</p><p>For one final, contradictory definition, the phrase &ldquo;core sleep&rdquo; is also used by people who are into polyphasic sleep. This is the idea that you can replace a full night&rsquo;s sleep with several naps during the day, something that <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-little-sleep-can-you-get-away-with-1788533845\" target=\"_blank\"><u>biohacker types keep trying to make happen, even though it never pans out</u></a>. They use the term pretty straightforwardly: If you have a nighttime nap that is longer than your other naps, that&rsquo;s your &ldquo;core sleep.&rdquo; Honestly, that&rsquo;s a fair use of the word. I'll allow it.</p><p>So, to wrap up: Core sleep, if you&rsquo;re a napper, is the longest block of sleep you get during a day. Core sleep, to scientists who study sleep deprivation, is a hypothesis about which part of a night&rsquo;s sleep is the most important. But if you&rsquo;re just here because you were wondering what your Apple sleep app means by \"core sleep,\" it means stages N1-N2, or light sleep.</p>"

The app allows you to take quick voice notes and embeds them inline into your text. Plus, once a voice note is recorded, you can also share the audio file with others.

You can choose any individual voice note and share it with anyone.</p><p>To record a voice note, create a new note and tap the <strong>paperclip</strong> icon, then select <strong>Record Audio</strong>. Next, hit the red record button when you're ready and start speaking. Tap the pause button to pause a recording or tap <strong>Done</strong> to finish.</p><h2>Your iPhone will even transcribe your voice notes</h2><p>With iOS 18, Notes can also transcribe your voice note for you, saving you the hassle of manually typing out everything you just recorded. This feature is available on iPhone 12 or newer and currently only supports one language&mdash;English. That said, it will work with the following regional differences:</p><ul><li><p>English (Australia)</p></li><li><p>English (Canada)</p></li><li><p>English (Ireland)</p></li><li><p>English (New Zealand)</p></li><li><p>English (South Africa)</p></li><li><p>English (UK)</p></li><li><p>English (U.S.).</p></li></ul><p>Oddly, iPhones also support two additional variations of English, namely English (India) and English (Singapore), but live audio transcription isn't yet available for these.</p><p>To transcribe audio in notes, tap on any audio recording in Notes, then the <strong>quotation mark</strong> at the bottom left of your screen. </p><h2>Solve math problems</h2><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1WQYY53JXJ78V4G5SG4SGQ7/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720026288.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Notes app, showing a math problem being solved.\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1WQYY53JXJ78V4G5SG4SGQ7/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1720026288.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1WQYY53JXJ78V4G5SG4SGQ7/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1720026288.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1WQYY53JXJ78V4G5SG4SGQ7/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720026288.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\"></span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Pranay Parab</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Apple Notes appears to be taking <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/your-ipad-actually-has-a-built-in-calculator\" target=\"_blank\">a leaf out of Soulver's book</a> and adding a feature that lets you solve math problems. You can quickly set up a bunch of variables and define their values within notes, such as x=10, y=20, and z=30, and Notes will be able to tell you what x+y+z is. You can also assign full names to your variables and Notes will still perform your calculations just fine. Support includes common math calculations including addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction. Math in notes uses the same tech powering the new <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/new-ipados-18-features-wwdc\" target=\"_blank\">Math Notes</a> section of the Calculator app.</p><h2>Navigate large notes with ease</h2><p>Notes has allowed you to break your notes down into sections for some time, but adding too many sections used to make your notes hard to skim through. In iOS 18, you can collapse the sections you want to skip, which significantly reduces the amount of scrolling needed to reach the end. Don't worry&mdash;collapsing a section of notes won't delete it. To use this feature, apply the <strong>Heading</strong> style to any section of notes, then tap the heading to collapse it.</p><h2>Add some color to your notes</h2><p>Some people like to use different colors when they're typing. Maybe you want to make important parts of your note pop or separate out topics by color. In Notes for iOS 18, you can easily try out different colors by tapping the <strong>Aa</strong> button from the Notes toolbar above the keyboard, then selecting the circle in the second row. You can choose one of the following options: purple, pink, orange, mint, and blue.</p>"

With this new line of smartphones, Apple may wrap the battery in a metal casing, rather than a foil one, allowing for a new removal process: Rather than having to pull on tabs to release the adhesive from the battery, you would send a low voltage burst of electricity through the battery casing to release it from the iPhone. If it pans out, the process sounds much safer and easier than the current system. </p><p>Apple wouldn't be doing this out of its concern for customers. Instead, it's likely in response to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/24/23771064/european-union-battery-regulation-ecodesign-user-replacable-batteries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">a new E.U. law</a> that requires smartphones to have \"replaceable batteries\" by 2025. Europe has had quite an influence over Apple's decisions over the past year, requiring the company to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-new-features-in-ios-174-are-eu-only\" target=\"_blank\">open up many of its closed platforms</a>, including allowing <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/is-it-safe-to-use-third-party-ios-app-store\" target=\"_blank\">independent app stores</a> and browsers on iOS.</p><p>Despite that pressure, only the battery will be easier to replace. There are no rumors suggesting Apple is making the rest of the iPhone repair process any simpler, so the iPhone 16 will likely still come with the usual strong adhesives on its casing that will need to be heated and broken in order to open the device.</p><h2>Apple's battery changes may also improve battery capacity</h2><p>This changes may mean more than just easier battery replacements. <a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1807432542934732953\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">According to noted Apple leaker Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Apple will also increase the battery density on the iPhone 16 line by 5 to 10%. That extra boost <em>could</em> result in longer battery life, but seeing as Apple is rolling out presumably power-hungry <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/all-four-iphone-16s-will-probably-get-apple-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Intelligence</a> features to these new iPhones, those battery gains <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/07/03/apple-to-upgrade-iphone-16-design-in-important-way-new-leak-claims/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">may quickly disappear</a>.</p>"

If they're that special, they should be displayed in a way that keeps them safe and out of the way. Here are some ideas for displaying those meaningful things you just can't get rid of.</p><h2>Try a high shelf</h2><p>I'm not a particularly emotional person, so I don't have <em>too </em>many mushy, sentimental, or nostalgic things lying around. The ones I do have, however, are far out of reach to prevent any accidental damage. If you have photos, tchotchkes, or, in my case, a pet's ashes and a rare bobblehead, consider a corner shelf they can rest on. </p><p>I am five feet tall, so I stood on a step stool to affix my corner shelf about six feet up, so I'll never, ever bump it or disturb it in any way, but I also took the precaution of putting it in a corner that is inaccessible and removed from daily activities. It's simple, like this:</p><div class=\"mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6\">\n    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/no2Lx?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Roundups&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=whole-shop-card&amp;element_label=evron%20Corner%20Mounting%20Shelf%2CEasy%20to%20Install%20Wall%20Corner%20Shelf&amp;short_url=no2Lx&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" data-commerce=\"1\" target=\"_blank\" data-parent-group=\"affiliate-link\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\" class=\"cursor-default no-underline\" data-ga-click=\"data-ga-click\" data-ga-item=\"whole-shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"evron Corner Mounting Shelf,Easy to Install Wall Corner Shelf\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap justify-between px-7 text-black no-underline md:flex-nowrap md:px-8\">\n            <div class=\"order-1 mx-auto flex flex-col justify-center md:order-2 md:ml-4 md:w-full md:grow\">\n                <div class=\"block cursor-pointer text-center font-akshar text-2xl font-medium leading-7 text-brand-green duration-200 ease-in-out hover:text-brand-green-700 md:text-left md:text-xl md:leading-6\">evron Corner Mounting Shelf,Easy to Install Wall Corner Shelf\n                </div>\n                                <div class=\"mt-4 hidden md:flex md:justify-between\">\n                                            <div class=\"self-end\">\n                            <div class=\"mb-0 h-11 md:flex md:flex-col md:justify-center\"><div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $9.99\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"flex items-center justify-center gap-x-1 font-bold md:justify-start\">\n            <span class=\"text-sm line-through\">$19.99</span>\n            <span class=\"text-sm text-brand-green\">Save $10.00</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"w-44 self-end\">\n                            <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Shop Now\n</button>\n                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 mt-5 h-auto w-full md:order-1 md:mt-0 md:hidden\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1X0WQJ6K81513JQC9K35B0E/images-1.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720034680.jpg\" alt=\"evron Corner Mounting Shelf,Easy to Install Wall Corner Shelf\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 ml-2 hidden w-32 shrink-0 items-center md:order-1 md:ml-0 md:flex\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1X0WQJ6K81513JQC9K35B0E/images-1.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720034680.jpg\" alt=\"evron Corner Mounting Shelf,Easy to Install Wall Corner Shelf\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-3 flex grow flex-wrap md:hidden md:grow-0\">\n                                    <div class=\"mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Shop Now\n</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"mx-2 mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $9.99\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"flex items-center justify-center gap-x-1 font-bold md:justify-start\">\n            <span class=\"text-sm line-through\">$19.99</span>\n            <span class=\"text-sm text-brand-green\">Save $10.00</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n</a></div>\n<p>In my opinion, anything delicate or important should be separated from other decorations, not on a larger shelf or mingling with other things. Show your sentimental pieces the respect they deserve by setting them apart. </p><h2>Safe storage and display for sentimental items</h2><p>If you have some photos you can't part with, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/the-best-ways-to-digitize-your-old-photos\" target=\"_blank\">I do recommend digitizing them</a> as the safest way to keep them forever. Still, displaying physical ones in your home can be a meaningful way to connect with fond memories, so obviously, you need picture frames. Instead of the delicate glass kind, opt for a sturdier acrylic frame with UV protection. This will prevent shards of glass from damaging the photo if it falls, and the UV protection will help prevent the image from fading or yellowing.</p><div class=\"mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6\">\n    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/qkn3p?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Roundups&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=whole-shop-card&amp;element_label=SimbaLux%20Magnetic%20Acrylic%20Picture%20Photo%20Frame%20with%20UV%20Protection&amp;short_url=qkn3p&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" data-commerce=\"1\" target=\"_blank\" data-parent-group=\"affiliate-link\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\" class=\"cursor-default no-underline\" data-ga-click=\"data-ga-click\" data-ga-item=\"whole-shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"SimbaLux Magnetic Acrylic Picture Photo Frame with UV Protection\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap justify-between px-7 text-black no-underline md:flex-nowrap md:px-8\">\n            <div class=\"order-1 mx-auto flex flex-col justify-center md:order-2 md:ml-4 md:w-full md:grow\">\n                <div class=\"block cursor-pointer text-center font-akshar text-2xl font-medium leading-7 text-brand-green duration-200 ease-in-out hover:text-brand-green-700 md:text-left md:text-xl md:leading-6\">SimbaLux Magnetic Acrylic Picture Photo Frame with UV Protection\n                </div>\n                                <div class=\"mt-4 hidden md:flex md:justify-between\">\n                                            <div class=\"self-end\">\n                            <div class=\"mb-0 h-11 md:flex md:flex-col md:justify-center\"><div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $25.95\n                            <span class=\"font-medium\">at Amazon</span>\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"w-44 self-end\">\n                            <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Shop Now\n</button>\n                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 mt-5 h-auto w-full md:order-1 md:mt-0 md:hidden\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1X0WQJ6K81513JQC9K35B0E/images-6.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720036346.jpg\" alt=\"Acrylic picture frame with UV protection\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 ml-2 hidden w-32 shrink-0 items-center md:order-1 md:ml-0 md:flex\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1X0WQJ6K81513JQC9K35B0E/images-6.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720036346.jpg\" alt=\"Acrylic picture frame with UV protection\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-3 flex grow flex-wrap md:hidden md:grow-0\">\n                                    <div class=\"mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Shop Now\n</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"mx-2 mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $25.95\n                            <span class=\"font-medium\">at Amazon</span>\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n</a></div>\n<p>For anything paper, like a child's old artwork, a certificate, or something similar, you want something that's easy to use, so you don't damage the paper while you're putting it in.

Laminate special papers, too; it won't be that visible inside whatever frame you choose for them, but they'll be a lot safer that way. </p><p>When I'm cleaning and it's time to dust and wash the shelf holding my special items, I remove them and put them in a box with a t-shirt or two, so they're on something soft and out of the way. It might seem like overkill, but I would be heartbroken if I accidentally damaged them.</p>"

Or perhaps you already have a few bells, and you&rsquo;re thinking it&rsquo;s time to get another&mdash;maybe something heavier, if you started out too light. The world contains multitudes of kettlebell options, from rainbow-colored competition bells to cast iron hardstyle bells to the molded plastic things you can buy at, say, a Five Below. Let&rsquo;s dissect the kettlebell market so you can pick the best bells for your needs.</p><p>And, yes, kettlebells are commonly called &ldquo;bells.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re also frequently labeled in kilograms rather than pounds, even in the U.S., but that will depend on the type of bell you&rsquo;re looking at.</p><h2>The difference between kettlebell types</h2><p>In the modern fitness world, there are three types of kettlebells. Before you go much further in your shopping journey, you&rsquo;ll have to figure out which type makes sense for you. I&rsquo;ll say more about each, but here&rsquo;s the basic roadmap.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cast iron or &ldquo;hardstyle&rdquo; kettlebells</strong> are usually black in color, and vary in size and shape. The heavier the bell, the bigger the round part is. These are used most often by people who do &ldquo;hardstyle&rdquo; kettlebell training, which I&rsquo;ll say more about in a bit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Competition kettlebells</strong> are designed to be the same size regardless of weight, so even the lightest bells will be roughly the size of a bowling ball. They are sold in kilograms (usually multiples of 4 or 8) and are color coded. A 16 kg bell, for example, will be yellow. These are used in a strength sport known as kettlebell sport or girevoy sport, where competitors race to get the most reps of a given lift in a 10-minute time period.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fitness kettlebells</strong>, for lack of a better term, are the miscellaneous bells you&rsquo;ll see at gyms or stores that don&rsquo;t really specialize in kettlebells. They might be plastic, or vinyl-coated, and the shape may or may not be something comfortable to hold.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Personally I think competition kettlebells are the best kind to work with, but I&rsquo;ve competed in kettlebell sport, so I&rsquo;m biased. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with hardstyle bells, if you like them or are used to them. (I think they&rsquo;re less comfortable to hold, but that&rsquo;s a preference rather than a dealbreaker.) The fitness kettlebells are a chaotic bunch, though: I&rsquo;ve used chrome-and-plastic ones that I almost like as much as my favorite comp bells, and I&rsquo;ve also seen oddly-shaped monstrosities that are pretty much impossible to work with. As a category, I&rsquo;d shy away. But if you <em>do</em> manage to find a fitness bell you enjoy working with, don&rsquo;t let me stop you.</p><p>Below, I&rsquo;ll give my picks for some good bells in each of my favorite categories, and I&rsquo;ll discuss the pros and cons of those types. But first, I know there&rsquo;s a burning question on your mind: how heavy?</p><h2>What kettlebell weight should I start with?&nbsp;</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t believe in the idea that there is a single &ldquo;correct&rdquo; weight to start with. I mean, you wouldn&rsquo;t walk into a gym, see a rack of dumbbells, and assume you&rsquo;d only work with one pair of dumbbells for your first few months, would you?&nbsp;</p><p>But it&rsquo;s common to start with one kettlebell, so people want a single recommendation. I&rsquo;m okay with this, so long as you understand that you want <strong>a heavy kettlebell for swings, and a light one for presses and snatches</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>For the lighter kettlebell, we can go with the standard recommendations you&rsquo;ll see in kettlebell books and forums. This should give you a bell that you can press overhead, or that (once you learn the technique) you can snatch. <em>Very generally</em>, you can go with:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>8 kg (about 18 pounds)</strong> if you are a small person and/or inexperienced with strength training</p></li><li><p><strong>12 kg (about 26 pounds)</strong> if you fall in between the above and below descriptions</p></li><li><p><strong>16 kg (about 35 pounds)</strong> if you are experienced with strength training&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Or try this test</strong>: If you have access to dumbbells or kettlebells (even in a store), find a weight that you can press overhead multiple times.</p></li></ul><p>Feel free to go higher or lower than these examples. Often you&rsquo;ll hear a recommendation that women should start with 8 to 12 kg, and men should start with 12 to 16. But this is really a recommendation that should be based on <em>strength</em>, not gender; plenty of women would do fine with a 16 as their first bell. And there are people of all genders who might be better off with something lighter than an 8, or heavier than a 16. Which is why I recommend that people experiment with various bells to see what makes sense. If you train with dumbbells, you can use your usual weight for a single-hand dumbbell press to guide your choice here.</p><p>For your heavier kettlebell, you want a bell that is so heavy you <em>cannot</em> press it. I <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/for-fucks-sake-please-stop-swinging-light-kettlebells-1850344356\" target=\"_blank\"><u>have some guidelines here</u></a> on finding the perfect weight for a heavy bell that you can swing. Somewhere between a 24 (53 pounds) and a 32 (70 pounds) will be a good starting place for most beginners. You can certainly go heavier than a 32 though. And you <em>can</em> swing your lighter bell, but I&rsquo;d recommend learning to swing with a heavy bell first. The weight is instructive.</p><h2>The best cast iron or &ldquo;hardstyle&rdquo; kettlebells</h2><p>Cast iron kettlebells are a good first choice for many people, because they are cheap and durable. They&rsquo;re available in a range of weights, including heavy ones. My first kettlebells were hardstyle, and they were perfectly good to train with.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Hardstyle\" is a nickname for a type of kettlebell training that commonly uses these bells. Probably most of the kettlebell exercises you've seen in a gym are versions of this. There are swings, windmills, presses, Turkish get-ups, and more. The swings are often done with two hands on the same bell, and exercises are done in sets and reps (as opposed to kettlebell competition training, which uses timed sets). You can do these exercises with any type of bells, so don't feel like you <em>need</em> to use cast iron&mdash;but that is the more common type. </p><p>The main disadvantages of cast iron kettlebells come down to the shape. Unlike competition bells, which are uniform in shape and size no matter the weight, cast iron bells are each shaped differently. At smaller weights, a large handle has to angle itself downward into a baseball-sized lump of iron. At larger weights, the main part of the bell is maybe the size of a bowling ball (or bigger!) and the handle had better be able to support it. You might learn how to hold a 12 kg bell comfortably enough to press it, but then you move up to a 16 kg bell, and suddenly everything is different and you need to re-learn your technique.&nbsp;</p><p>When buying cast iron kettlebells, check that the entire bell is cast in one piece (a welded-on handle is a liability) and make sure the handle is comfortable. Your hand will rub against the handle whether you&rsquo;re swinging, cleaning, or adjusting your grip mid-snatch, so make sure there are no jagged edges. If the bell feels good to use, enjoy!

They tend to be more expensive, but they&rsquo;re uniform in shape so the different weights will feel very similar in your hand. Kettlebell sport practitioners work on the efficiency of their technique, so once you learn the exact place to put your elbow in a clean position (for example), you&rsquo;ll be able to replicate that even when you change weights.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, brands still vary slightly in size and shape. You might prefer one brand&rsquo;s &ldquo;window&rdquo; (the hole in the handle) to another&mdash;maybe it&rsquo;s a bit wider or more square shaped. There are also competition-style bells with indentations where your forearm goes during overhead lifts. I also have one more preference when it comes to competition bells: they should stick with standard color coding! Pink for 8 kg, yellow for 16, green for 24, red for 32, and so on. Some brands (<em>cough</em>Titan<em>cough</em>) have begun offering their competition style bells in non-standard colors, and I am mad about it. But in your own home gym, I suppose you can lift any color bell you like.

						"__cdata": "<p>The Fourth of July is the United States' unofficial national grilling holiday&mdash;and if nothing else, charring meat outside with friends is worth celebrating. Whether you&rsquo;ve hosted a few burger sessions already this summer, or you&rsquo;ve wheeled in your very first charcoal grill, it&rsquo;s important to brush up on your safety before you strike a match. Here are the things you should do and the tools you might need, before, during, and after the last dog comes off the grill.&nbsp;</p><h2>Before you grill</h2><p><strong>Place the grill in an appropriate place.</strong> In the event that a stray spark flies, or a wicked flare-up occurs, you want to be clear of anything that could catch fire. Grills, especially charcoal grills, should be at least 10 feet away from the house, railings, overhanging tree branches, and anything combustible. For gas grills, check your state fire code for distance minimums. If you can manage it, 10 feet seems to be the way to go. Make sure you&rsquo;re grilling in an outdoor open area so no carbon monoxide can build up.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Establish a safety zone.</strong> With kids running around and dogs catching frisbees across the yard, it&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in the moment. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to establish a defined circle around your grill that&rsquo;s a &ldquo;no-go zone.&rdquo; Use bright colorful chalk for concrete, <a

						"__cdata": "<p>Retirement is one of those milestones that seem far away until they're suddenly right on top of you. After decades of working and saving for retirement (you <em>did</em> <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-the-80-retirement-rule-is-bullshit-1849762139\" target=\"_blank\">save for retirement</a>, right?) you&rsquo;re suddenly faced with <em>actually</em> retiring. And your final year before retirement could be really fun and exciting&mdash;work problems don&rsquo;t matter so much, and you get to make lots of fun plans for your upcoming free time&mdash;or really scary. Either way, now is the time to take the essential steps to ensure you&rsquo;re ready for what&rsquo;s coming.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t just about prepping your <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/all-the-different-retirement-accounts-you-can-take-adva-1850950256\" target=\"_blank\">retirement accounts</a> and investments (though you should definitely meet with your financial advisor and ensure you&rsquo;re in good financial shape). You should also consider taking the following five steps when you're about a year out from retirement&mdash;because it will be harder to do them later.</p><h2>Make the most of your benefits (including your PTO)</h2><p>Your job offers <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-evaluate-a-benefits-package-before-you-accept-a-1846936196\" target=\"_blank\">benefits</a> that are part of your overall compensation. It&rsquo;s always important to make sure you use all of them that you can, both because they&rsquo;re owed to you, and because you shouldn't leave anything on the table.</p><p>Review your employer&rsquo;s policy on paid time off (PTO). Do they let you bank those days? If so, how many do you have sitting unused because you&rsquo;re as American as apple pie and <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2024/06/20/americans-vacation-study-expedia-2024/74144817007/#:~:text=The%20study%20found%20that%20Americans,off%20a%20year%20on%20average.&amp;text=The%20reasons%20are%20all%20too,more%20without%20taking%20a%20vacation.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">never go on vacation</a>? Will your company pay those out to you in cash when you retire, or will you lose them? If it's the latter, start planning how you can use them now. Having some extra time off before you officially retire isn&rsquo;t the worst thing, and certainly better than letting all that time or money go to waste.</p><p>In fact, you should review all the benefits you get through your employer to see what you should be taking advantage of before you leave and lose access to them. Everything from health and lifestyle programs, to tuition reimbursements, to employee discount programs should be milked for everything they&rsquo;re worth, because once you turn in your paperwork they&rsquo;ll be gone.</p><h2>Consider a HELOC/Refinance</h2><p>If you have a big expense coming up in the near future, you should consider how you&rsquo;ll pay for it now, before you actually retire. That&rsquo;s because refinancing your mortgage, opening up a home equity line of credit (HELOC), or getting a home equity loan can be <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/mortgage-denial-rates-and-household-finances-among-older-americans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">more difficult</a> when you&rsquo;re retired, as you don&rsquo;t have the steady income of a paycheck, and banks sometimes struggle to make their standard models work. HELOCs can be dormant for many years, so having one on hand can mean you have the funds you need for major repairs or other projects in the future.</p><p>Proceed with caution here, however: If you haven't identified a use for a HELOC, the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/11/helocs-can-hurt-you.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">potential risks</a> of having one&mdash;including spending the money just because it&rsquo;s there&mdash;may not be worth it. But if you think you might need to tap into your home&rsquo;s equity, setting it up before you retire will be easier.</p><h2>Get a complete medical checkup</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re a year out from retirement, you&rsquo;ve probably already looked into how you&rsquo;ll get health insurance coverage after you leave your job, whether using private insurance or Medicare and some kind of &ldquo;gap&rdquo; insurance plan. But whatever your plan is, you should get a thorough physical checkup now, when you&rsquo;re still around a year away from retirement. The coverage you have through your employer may be superior to Medicare, so finding out you have a serious condition or need expensive surgery <em>now</em> might save you a bundle over dealing with it when it&rsquo;s all on your own dime. Even if that&rsquo;s not the case, or you decide to put off treatment for reasons other than finances, knowing that you might have to deal with something will allow you to plan ahead instead of having to react later.</p><h2>Give your retirement budget a test run</h2><p>You made a budget for your retirement years, didn&rsquo;t you? Well, the time to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/19/how-to-stress-test-retirement-strategy-amid-inflation-market-downturn.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">test it out</a> is while you&rsquo;re still working. You&rsquo;ve come up with numbers&mdash;income versus expenses&mdash;but you won&rsquo;t know whether they actually work until you've lived with them. While you still have a year of work left, try living on the income you expect from your retirement assets (including Social Security, if you qualify). It won&rsquo;t be a perfect model because you&rsquo;ll still be in work mode and possible spending money you won't have to once you retire, but it will give you some idea of how realistic your estimates are. If you find yourself miserable and struggling, you&rsquo;ll need to reshape your plan&mdash;and having the option of working a little longer might be a life-saver. Even if you stay committed to your retirement date, you&rsquo;ll have time to figure out <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/seven-retirement-side-hustles-that-offer-more-than-money\" target=\"_blank\">side hustles</a> or expense reduction options in a calm and efficient manner.</p><h2>Research your Medicare options</h2><p>Finally, take the year and do some research on your health insurance options. Medicare is <a href=\"https://fortune.com/well/2023/11/20/medicare-confusion-coverage-fees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><em>complicated</em></a>, folks, and messing up your coverage or not having the right supplemental plan can not only hurt your health and wellbeing, it can make a deep dent in your pocketbook. The time to ensure you really, actually understand it is now, while you&rsquo;re still covered by your employer&rsquo;s insurance and you still have the flexibility to change your retirement plans or financial strategy.</p><p>If you do these five things, you&rsquo;ll (hopefully) face ignificantly fewer regrets in retirement&mdash;and that peace of mind will be priceless.</p>"

Here are the best ways to cover up those ugly fixtures. </p><h2>Put up a fence or privacy screen</h2><p>The most straightforward way to hide an eyesore is to install a fence, privacy screen, or box to cover it up. This can work especially well for garbage bins or large HVAC units that are visible from multiple angles. You can upgrade even further by selecting a decorative panel or natural plant screen, painting the fencing, or adding vertical garden elements (more on this below). </p><h2>Add a trellis or plant a vertical garden</h2><p>If you want a more natural look, consider installing a trellis or adding vining plants that will grow up your fence (especially if you need to cover chain links).

Alternatively, you can <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/11-spectacular-vertical-gardens-you-can-grow-in-small-s-1850197734\" target=\"_blank\">create a vertical garden</a> out of items like ladders, pallets, and even shoe organizers. </p><p>If you don't have something for plants to grow or vine up, you can still arrange individual pots in front of or around the feature you want to hide. This allows you to keep your barriers mobile for easy access. </p><h2>Install a birdhouse or birdbath</h2><p>For utility boxes or wall-mounted meters and panels, consider building a three-sided birdhouse you can mount around the fixture (and with a door that can still open to provide easy access). Birdbaths can also offer some camouflage for ground-level features.  </p><div class=\"mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6\">\n    <a

aesthetically pleasing. Consider a pot with a hole or an outdoor bench with storage, both which will hide the hose entirely. </p><p>If you can't cover a fixture, install something that draws the eye (or ear) away from it. The sound of a water feature can cover the buzzing of an HVAC unit, for example, while a garden sculpture, fire pit, or patio furniture can distract from other unsightly features. </p><h2>Paint </h2><p>If you have a boring fence or plain pipes, consider painting them either to camouflage (matching what's nearby or the exterior of your home) or to add a decorative element. For example, you can create an industrial feel by painting exposed plumbing pipes matte black or a metallic hue. Make sure you use paint or spray paint that's intended for the material you're covering up. </p>"

A <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-difference-between-an-economic-recession-and-a-depr-1849445905\" target=\"_blank\">traditional recession</a> is typically defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, as measured by a country's gross domestic product (GDP). It's often accompanied by rising unemployment rates, falling consumer spending, and a decline in industrial production. According to this definition, we are not technically in a recession. So, how come <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/americans-experiencing-silent-recession/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">so many of us still feel like we're financially struggling</a>?</p><p>The answer may be a so-called \"<a href=\"https://nbc24.com/news/nation-world/survey-shows-many-americans-feel-like-were-in-a-silent-recession-economy-finances-money-pay-income-banking-shopping-consumer-sentiment-jobs-employment-gdp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">silent recession</a>.\" This is a more subtle economic downturn that may not meet the technical criteria of a traditional recession but still impacts the daily lives of many individuals. During a silent recession, the stock market often remains stable and unemployment appears low, but people still have trouble making ends meet or are living paycheck to paycheck. Let's take a look at what it means to be in a silent recession, and what it means for your finances.</p><h2>Signs of a silent recession</h2><p>While official economic indicators may paint a positive picture, several signs can point to a silent recession:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Stagnant wages</strong>: Despite low unemployment, wages may not keep pace with inflation, leading to reduced purchasing power.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-calculate-the-real-unemployment-rate-and-why-it-1849447911\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Underemployment</strong></a>: People may be working, but in jobs that don't fully utilize their skills or provide sufficient hours.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increased debt</strong>: Individuals and families may <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-pay-off-credit-card-debt\" target=\"_blank\">rely more heavily on credit</a> to maintain their standard of living.</p></li><li><p><strong>Housing issues</strong>: Rising housing costs may outpace income growth, making it difficult for many to afford homes or rent.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reduced savings</strong>: People may find it challenging to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/heres-how-much-money-you-should-have-in-your-emergency-1850070761\" target=\"_blank\">save for emergencies</a> or long-term goals.</p></li></ol><h2>Are we in a silent recession?</h2><p>While the U.S. economy has shown resilience through the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/what-you-should-do-now-to-prepare-for-a-recession-1849129353\" target=\"_blank\">past few years of recession fears</a> (including the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/heres-what-happens-when-everyone-panics-and-pulls-money-1850323040\" target=\"_blank\">failure of three U.S. banks in 2023</a>), signs indicate the possibility of a silent recession. There's undoubtedly a disconnect between positive economic indicators and the financial struggles of many Americans.</p><p>After all, your economic picture can vary widely based on factors such as location, industry, and individual circumstances. While some sectors and individuals may be thriving, others may be facing significant financial pressures. If this sounds like you, let's take a look at some tips to get your finances back on track.</p><h2>Tips for navigating a recession</h2><p>Whether facing a traditional or silent recession, or simply struggling on an individual level, there are steps you can take to improve your financial stability:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Build an emergency fund</strong>: Aim to save around six months of living expenses to provide a buffer during tough times. Here are my tips to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/heres-how-much-money-you-should-have-in-your-emergency-1850070761\" target=\"_blank\">getting this fund off the ground</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Diversify income streams</strong>: Consider <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-create-a-passive-income-stream\" target=\"_blank\">developing multiple sources of income</a> to reduce reliance on a single job.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reduce debt</strong>: Identify your highest-rate debts and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/debt-avalanche-or-debt-snowball-method-to-pay-off-debt\" target=\"_blank\"><u>create a plan to tackle them aggressively</u></a> before they balloon out of control.</p></li><li><p><strong>Live below your means</strong>: Or, at least, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/beware-the-costs-of-lifestyle-creep-1849672721\" target=\"_blank\">avoid lifestyle creep</a>. During a recession, your means of increasing your income&mdash;raises, promotions, and side hustles&mdash;will be limited. So while it feels more ideal to start bringing in more money, focusing on cutting back is perhaps more important.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stay informed</strong>: Recessions make everything uncertain. Stay sane by <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money\" target=\"_blank\">staying on top of money news</a>, and adjust your financial strategy accordingly.</p></li></ol><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>While the U.S. may not be in a traditional recession as of 2024, the concept of a silent recession highlights the complex nature of economic well-being.  It all serves as a reminder that official economic indicators don't always reflect the financial realities of many individuals and families. Eye-catching headlines will never be an accurate snapshot of your personal financial picture.</p><p>By focusing on proactive steps to strengthen personal finances, you can better navigate both traditional and silent recessions.

They should be grouped, labeled, and organized so they don't get all tangled up&mdash;but that doesn't mean your organizers have to look industrial or boring. Here are some options for any room or situation. </p><h2>The best cord managers for bigger tech</h2><p>Until recently, the area behind my television was kind of a no-man's-land. Cords from the television, gaming console, streaming plug-in, and the nearby lamps, Peloton, and fan all joined together in a chaotic mess. I stuck them all into one long power strip and hoped for the best, but eventually, I realized I had to do something a little more organized. First, I got a nicer-looking power strip, one that matched my decor, had USB and lightning ports, and was round, so the cords did less overlapping. I removed the wall adapter from anything that could be plugged straight into the ports and it made a huge difference right away. </p><div class=\"mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6\">\n    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/4ARNG?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Roundups&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=whole-shop-card&amp;element_label=NTONPOWER%20Pink%20Power%20Strip&amp;short_url=4ARNG&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" data-commerce=\"1\" target=\"_blank\" data-parent-group=\"affiliate-link\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\" class=\"cursor-default no-underline\" data-ga-click=\"data-ga-click\" data-ga-item=\"whole-shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"NTONPOWER Pink Power Strip\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap justify-between px-7 text-black no-underline md:flex-nowrap md:px-8\">\n            <div class=\"order-1 mx-auto flex flex-col justify-center md:order-2 md:ml-4 md:w-full md:grow\">\n                <div class=\"block cursor-pointer text-center font-akshar text-2xl font-medium leading-7 text-brand-green duration-200 ease-in-out hover:text-brand-green-700 md:text-left md:text-xl md:leading-6\">NTONPOWER Pink Power Strip\n                </div>\n                                <div class=\"mt-4 hidden md:flex md:justify-between\">\n                                            <div class=\"self-end\">\n                            <div class=\"mb-0 h-11 md:flex md:flex-col md:justify-center\"><div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $18.99\n                            <span class=\"font-medium\">at Amazon</span>\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"w-44 self-end\">\n                            <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Learn More\n</button>\n                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 mt-5 h-auto w-full md:order-1 md:mt-0 md:hidden\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1WPNBDPQAR3KCH9Y9ZYN1M2/images-1.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720023952.jpg\" alt=\"NTONPOWER Pink Power Strip, 5ft Extension Cord\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 ml-2 hidden w-32 shrink-0 items-center md:order-1 md:ml-0 md:flex\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1WPNBDPQAR3KCH9Y9ZYN1M2/images-1.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720023952.jpg\" alt=\"NTONPOWER Pink Power Strip, 5ft Extension Cord\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-3 flex grow flex-wrap md:hidden md:grow-0\">\n                                    <div class=\"mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Learn More\n</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"mx-2 mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $18.99\n                            <span class=\"font-medium\">at Amazon</span>\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n</a></div>\n<p>I really, really love this thing.

It has holes in the back so you can even hang it on some screws, stopping it from moving around.</p><p>Still, a lot of cords feed into it, so to keep those organized and prevent them from getting tangled, I wanted to get a few cord organizers. I used to only think there was one kind of cable manager, that long strip that you hooked different cords through, but I was thrilled to learn there are way better options. Since all the cords in that area come from different spots around that side of the room, it didn't make sense to try to stick them all through one long organizer; getting individual organizers to attach to the wall or shelving nearest each corded object was the best choice, as it meant I didn't have to rearrange anything. </p><div class=\"mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6\">\n    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/BdBM8?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Roundups&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=whole-shop-card&amp;element_label=Six-Pack%20Magnetic%20Cable%20Organizer&amp;short_url=BdBM8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" data-commerce=\"1\" target=\"_blank\" data-parent-group=\"affiliate-link\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\" class=\"cursor-default no-underline\" data-ga-click=\"data-ga-click\" data-ga-item=\"whole-shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Six-Pack Magnetic Cable Organizer\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap justify-between px-7 text-black no-underline md:flex-nowrap md:px-8\">\n            <div class=\"order-1 mx-auto flex flex-col justify-center md:order-2 md:ml-4 md:w-full md:grow\">\n                <div class=\"block cursor-pointer text-center font-akshar text-2xl font-medium leading-7 text-brand-green duration-200 ease-in-out hover:text-brand-green-700 md:text-left md:text-xl md:leading-6\">Six-Pack Magnetic Cable Organizer\n                </div>\n                                <div class=\"mt-4 hidden md:flex md:justify-between\">\n                                            <div class=\"self-end\">\n                            <div class=\"mb-0 h-11 md:flex md:flex-col md:justify-center\"><div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $15.99\n                            <span class=\"font-medium\">at Amazon </span>\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"w-44 self-end\">\n                            <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Shop Now\n</button>\n                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 mt-5 h-auto w-full md:order-1 md:mt-0 md:hidden\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1WPNBDPQAR3KCH9Y9ZYN1M2/images-2.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720023952.jpg\" alt=\"6 Pack Magnetic Cable Organizer, Adhesive Desk Cord Management\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 ml-2 hidden w-32 shrink-0 items-center md:order-1 md:ml-0 md:flex\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1WPNBDPQAR3KCH9Y9ZYN1M2/images-2.fill.size_autoxauto.v1720023952.jpg\" alt=\"6 Pack Magnetic Cable Organizer, Adhesive Desk Cord Management\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-3 flex grow flex-wrap md:hidden md:grow-0\">\n                                    <div class=\"mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Shop Now\n</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"mx-2 mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $15.99\n                            <span class=\"font-medium\">at Amazon </span>\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n</a></div>\n<p>Of course, those longer strips are useful in some cases, like when you're <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/desk-organization-tips\" target=\"_blank\">organizing a computer desk</a>.

						"__cdata": "<p>Fifteen years in, Apple's annual iPhone releases have gotten pretty predictable&mdash;we've come to expect four new iPhones (including two larger size options), two Pro models and two standard devices. In recent years, you could also expect to need to go Pro in order to get the best chips Apple had on offer. But if reports are correct, that might be changing this year. </p><h2>Every iPhone 16 model will like get the A18 chip</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/02/iphone-16-models-a18-chip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">As reported by MacRumors</a>, Apple's backend code reveals that the company is working on four iPhone 16 models to release this year. That's not surprising at all, but what <em>is</em> surprising is all four models appear to reference the same A-series chip. In fact, <a href=\"https://x.com/nicolas09F9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Nicol&aacute;s Alvarez discovered</a> five A-series entries in this code, each with a unique identifier not tied to any existing iPhone:</p><ul><li><p>iPhone17,1</p></li><li><p>iPhone17,2</p></li><li><p>iPhone17,3</p></li><li><p>iPhone17,4</p></li><li><p>iPhone17,5</p></li></ul><p>Don't be confused by the \"17\"&mdash;these names refer not to the iPhone 17, but to the A18 chip Apple is developing for the iPhone 16. (Okay, maybe it's a little confusing.) The interesting bit is that all of these entries share the \"iPhone17\" moniker, which shows that Apple is working on five devices with the A18 chip. (Perhaps the fifth model is a new <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/everything-you-need-to-know-before-you-buy-the-new-ipho-1848628418\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone SE</a>?)</p><p>If any of these iPhones were using a different chip, you would see that reflected in the name here. As MacRumors highlights, in Apple's backend code, the iPhone 15 is listed as \"iPhone 15,4,\" since it uses the A16 chip, while the iPhone 15 Pro is listed as \"iPhone 16,1,\" since it uses the A17 chip.</p><p>To that point, it's great news is all of Apple's upcoming iPhones using the same chip. For the past two product cycles, Apple has recycled the previous year's Pro chip for the standard iPhones, reserving the best A-series chip for only the latest Pro devices. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/should-you-buy-the-iphone-14-or-14-pro-1849506382\" target=\"_blank\">The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus use the A15 chip from the iPhone 13</a>, while the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/iphone-14-plus-versus-iphone-15-plus-1850838772\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus use the A16 chip from the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max</a>. </p><h2>All four iPhone 16s may be Apple Intelligence-ready</h2><p>While it's possible Apple will beef up the A18 chip in the iPhone 16 Pros to give consumers something to stretch their dollar for, the likely consequence of the above news is this: All four new iPhone 16s will probably be compatible with <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-bringing-ai-to-iphone-ipad-mac-wwdc\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Intelligence</a>, Apple's upcoming suite of generative AI features.</p><p>Right now, the only iPhones officially compatible with Apple Intelligence <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-intelligence-on-iphone-requirements\" target=\"_blank\">are the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>. Not even the iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Plus are compatible, even though they're as new as the 15 Pros, as their A-series chips are a generation older. Given the recent buzz around AI, it makes sense that, going forward, the company would want all new iPhones to work with Apple Intelligence&mdash;though I would have assumed that would've been true of the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus regardless, as even if Apple stuck to their recent tradition of using last year's Pro chips in the base models, these iPhones would've shipped with the iPhone 15 Pros' A17 chip, which is Apple Intelligence-ready. </p><h2>The standard iPhone 16 might be the best value choice</h2><p>Either way, it seems the standard iPhone 16 will be a good value this year for anyone wanting to balance their device's power with price. I'm sure Apple will soup up the 16 Pros in other ways, perhaps with higher-end A18 chips, superior cameras, and other exclusive features. But if you're simply looking for an iPhone that can run Apple's latest AI features without spending $1,000 for the privilege, it's looking like the iPhone 16 will be that phone. </p>"

						"__cdata": "<p>The conversation around retirement is usually <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-retire-when-you-have-basically-nothing-saved-1850391373\" target=\"_blank\">centered around money</a>&mdash;whether you&rsquo;ll have enough, what &ldquo;enough&rdquo; even means, and how to plan ahead for unexpected financial needs like home repairs or health issues. Side hustles in retirement are usually discussed the same way: <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/money/the-weirdest-side-hustles-that-can-make-money\" target=\"_blank\">How much</a> can you earn?</p><p>But when you're retired, side hustles aren't necessarily 100% about the money. For one thing, if Social Security is a big part of your retirement plan, there&rsquo;s an upper limit on how much you can earn without those benefits <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/whileworking.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">being penalized</a>. For another, retirement itself isn&rsquo;t all about money. If you&rsquo;re not careful, you can find retirement to be a boring, lonely period of your life where your physical and mental health declines&mdash;but the right side hustle can help defend against those problems.</p><h2>Side hustle benefits</h2><p>Aside from bringing in a little cash, side hustles can offer a range of benefits for anyone navigating their retirement:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hobbies and passions.</strong> Pursuing hobbies and passion projects can be a <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-90016-001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">strong defense against depression</a>, especially in older people. While diving into hobbies just for pleasure is just as effective, finding side hustles that monetize your hobbies and interests can offer an even greater sense of purpose.</p></li><li><p><strong>Physical fitness.</strong> Staying physically active has a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/health-benefits/older-adults.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">long list of benefits</a> for older people (including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/well/move/exercise-health-care-cost-savings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">vastly reduced</a> healthcare costs over the course of their retirement). Side hustles that require physical activity can help keep you moving.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social contact.</strong> We have a tendency to become <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/well/loneliness-mental-health-age.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">lonelier after age 60</a>, for a variety of reasons&mdash;including the loss of social circles we had at our jobs. A side hustle can bring back that &ldquo;work family,&rdquo; or just put us in contact with people on a regular basis.</p></li></ul><p>Sure, side-hustle cash is also great&mdash;and often necessary. But choosing the right retirement side hustle can offer these other benefits as well. Here are some of the best choices.</p><h2>Part-time retail</h2><p>Retirees doing retail work is something of a clich&eacute;, but retail work can offer consistent social contact with people. Seeing people every day strengthens your connection to your local community while also giving you a sense of purpose as you help your neighbors solve problems or navigate their own lives. And finding a retail job that capitalizes on the skills you developed during your working life (retired tradespeople working at hardware stores, for example) can allow you to continue to do the work you enjoy and benefit from your skills and experience.</p><h2>Pet sitting or walking</h2><p>If you find yourself sitting around your house, bored and lonely, both your mental and physical health will suffer. <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/pets-can-protect-cognitive-health-in-older-adults\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Studies</a> have shown that owning a pet offers powerful emotional and mental benefits, but pets can also be <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/pet-insurance/cost-of-pet-ownership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">expensive to support</a>.</p><p>Working as a pet sitter or dog walker can bring you the emotional benefits of interacting with adorable animals without the cost, with the added benefit of introducing more physical activity (<a href=\"https://www.kurufootwear.com/a/blog/dog-walking-habits-in-america\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">one survey</a> found that dog owners walk their dogs an average of 30 miles a week). Sites like <a href=\"https://www.rover.com/become-a-sitter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Rover</a> or <a href=\"https://wagwalking.com/dog-walker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Wag</a> make it easy to jump into this side hustle, and thus easy to bring some companionship and physical activity into your life.</p><h2>Local tour guide</h2><p>You know your community better than anyone, so why not boost your social interaction and get some exercise while you&rsquo;re at it? Sites like <a href=\"https://www.toursbylocals.com/become-a-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">ToursByLocals</a> need local folks who can lead guided tours of their area, so you can meet new people, share your knowledge and experience, and stay in shape with a lot of walking and other activities.</p><h2>Career coaching</h2><p>You spent decades cultivating skills and experience in your profession, and there are plenty of people who could benefit from that. If you&rsquo;re having trouble making connections, if your skill set <em>was</em> your hobby and passion, becoming a career coach could be a way of having more personal connection and keeping your passions burning. Sites like <a href=\"https://hireclub.com/join\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Hire Club</a> are looking for experienced, accomplished people to help their clients reach the next level in their careers, so it could be a great way to feel valued and feel like you&rsquo;re making an impact by mentoring others.</p><h2>Tutoring</h2><p>If career coaching isn&rsquo;t your bag, or your skills aren&rsquo;t aligned with corporate ladder-climbers, another way to boost your social circles while applying your hard-won knowledge and skills to a side hustle is tutoring. Sites like <a href=\"http://Tutors.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Tutors.com</a> let you sign up to find tutoring options in your area, and people are always looking for tutors to help them or their kids master different subjects, so your local Craigslist or a simple Google search can lead you to tutoring gigs. And sites like <a href=\"https://teach.italki.com/application\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">italki</a> have options for folks without teaching certificates to be a language tutor. Either way, tutoring connects you with a variety of different people and lets you pursue your passions for a little extra money.</p><h2>Gardening</h2><p>If you have a green thumb and find yourself lacking in the physical activity department, taking on seasonal work as a gardener or landscaper can keep you fit while letting you indulge your passions. Whether you were a gardening or landscaping professional during your working life or just an inspired amateur with a backyard filled with gorgeous plants, this is a side hustle that will keep you moving.</p><h2>Renting out a room</h2><p>If physical activity isn&rsquo;t the problem, but feeling isolated is, renting out a room or an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) can bring in rent money as well as the comfort of a roommate. Sites like <a href=\"https://www.nesterly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Nesterly</a> specifically connect older homeowners with younger renters, with the former offering a break on the rent in exchange for some chores. That can be a comfort if you&rsquo;re finding keeping up with your housekeeping more of a challenge, but it can also lead to true <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/07/15/multigenerational-housing-roommates-nesterly-senior/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">friendships</a> and unexpected social connections.</p><p></p>"

						"__cdata": "<p>That fact that a film is misinterpreted can&rsquo;t always be laid at the feet of an audience: Director Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut famously suggested that it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to make an anti-war film, since the job of a filmmaker is to create compelling characters and situations that inevitably make war look exciting. You can extend that thinking to the creation of compelling villains and anti-heroes&mdash;Michael Douglas&rsquo; Gordon Gekko, the odious stockbroker in Oliver Stone&rsquo;s <em>Wall Street,</em> became a hero to many who took his satirical &ldquo;greed is good&rdquo; catchphrase literally. <br><br>It&rsquo;s true that sometimes filmmakers do their jobs <em>too</em> well, undercutting their own point by making their bad guys too compelling. Darth Vader racked up one of the biggest body counts in cinematic history, and still wound up on every kid&rsquo;s lunchbox. Marketing can also be a problem; trailers train us to look for a certain type of movie, so once we&rsquo;re in the theater, it can be hard to see anything different. A film that looks like a failure as horror can seem brilliant once we realize that we&rsquo;re in a comedy&mdash;think <em>Evil Dead II.</em> We&rsquo;re trained to limit our expectations, and sometimes it just takes a more open mind.</p><p>So what are the most misunderstood movies ever&mdash;deservedly or not? In answering that question, I&rsquo;ve tried to stick to fairly objective readings, and avoiding overly elaborate fan theories (<em>The Shining</em> is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_237\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>probably not about the moon landing</u></a>). And I&rsquo;ll start with a caveat: No truly interesting movie can be subject to a single interpretation&mdash;even if the writer and director say it&rsquo;s about one thing, some viewers may have a different take. I&rsquo;m not saying you&rsquo;re wrong, just that there might be things you hadn&rsquo;t considered. (You&rsquo;re wrong if you buy that <em>Shining</em>/moon landing bit though.)</p><h2><em>Starship Troopers</em> (1997)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-zPYuV_jGk7M\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><em>Starship Troopers </em>is a wildly fascinating adaptation in the ways in which it takes straightforward source material&mdash;in this case, Robert A. Heinlein&rsquo;s 1959 novel&mdash;and satirizes largely by taking it at face value. It&rsquo;s a rather shocking bit of literary criticism disguised as a B-sci-fi movie, turning the novel&rsquo;s themes on their heads. At the risk of oversimplifying Heinlein, the novel (with a nearly identical plot) suggests that war is inevitable and that military service might be the best possible cure for a general moral decline. <br><br>Director Paul Verhoeven, who grew up in German-occupied Netherlands, called bullshit (while claiming he couldn&rsquo;t even finish the book). Instead, he created a wildly over-the-top satire that brings to the fore the novel&rsquo;s possible fascistic interpretations, opening his film with an &ldquo;homage&rdquo; to Leni Riefenstahl and including a series of Nazi-inspired propaganda segments. The lead characters have no compunctions whatsoever about treating the alien &ldquo;bugs&rdquo; to any and all manner of cruelty and medical experimentation because, well, they&rsquo;re the enemy, after all. Many early reviewers say it as a mindless spectacle or a straightforward paean to fascism; they clearly didn&rsquo;t get the joke.</p><p><strong>Where to stream:</strong> Netflix, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/ZRv3K?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Digital%20rental&amp;short_url=ZRv3K&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Digital rental</a></p><hr><h2><em>Skinamarink</em> (2022)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-APQqilSTxz0\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I'm not sure what people expected when they went to see instant cult film <em>Skinamarink</em>, nor how they interpreted it afterwards&mdash;but the relatively low audience score compared to fairly decent reviews from critics suggest that many viewers were various shades of unimpressed and/or confused. Part of the problem, I think, was in managing expectations: It's very hard to describe the film's plot, as it largely has none&mdash;we're entering here a world that's all atmosphere and vibe. Prior to completing this feature, writer/director Kyle Edward Ball ran a YouTube channel where he created short videos based on user-submitted childhood nightmares. <em>Skinamarink</em>, filmed in Ball's own childhood home, extends the nightmare to feature length and, on that level, makes perfect non-sensical sense, capturing the feeling of disorientation and fear so common to young childhood. Outside of David Lynch's oeuvre, I can't think of any other film that best captures the feeling of being at sea in a world made for grownups.</p><p><strong>Where to stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/2eemW?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Hulu&amp;short_url=2eemW&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Hulu</a>, Shudder, AMC+, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/8Bg1q?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Digital%20rental&amp;short_url=8Bg1q&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Digital rental</a></p><hr><h2><em>Fight Club</em> (1999)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-CR5Jp_ag2M8\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>To what extent ought a movie be held responsible for its fanbase? I&rsquo;ll spare you a rundown of all of the actual fight clubs that rose up in the years following this 1999 David Fincher film&rsquo;s release, but a quick internet search reveals there&rsquo;s probably one near you, if you&rsquo;re so inclined. Like the various men&rsquo;s encounter groups that cropped up in the mid-&rsquo;90s, <em>Fight Club</em> looked to an awful lot of viewers like a plea to reconnect with a certain type of stock masculinity&mdash;take off your shirt, make some soap, and beat the shit out of other guys, if only to feel <em>something</em>. Tyler Durden became a hero. <br><br>The thing is, that&rsquo;s the furthest thing from what writer Chuck Palahniuk intended; the book the film is based on makes the case that replacing numbness and capitalistic materialism with typical American male tough-guy bullshit is a like-for-like exchange. The film falls down, perhaps, by making Durden too seductive (his plot to wipe out credit card debt also has a certain appeal), but the film concludes with Ed Norton&rsquo;s Narrator using a gun to free himself from Tyler Durden&rsquo;s influence, after all. That&rsquo;s the bit many viewers seem to have overlooked.</p><p><strong>Where to stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/2eemW?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Hulu&amp;short_url=2eemW&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Hulu</a></p><hr><h2><em>The Shining</em> (1980)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-yMRmV1Sj6j4\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Where to start with <em>The Shining</em>? It&rsquo;s a movie that both defies explanation and, simultaneously, has generated enough interpretations to inspire a whole <em>other </em>movie (Rodney Ascher&rsquo;s <em>Room 237</em>) that delves into the pet theories of fans. The biggest misunderstanding here is about what the movie is intended to be. Stephen King was notoriously dissatisfied with the adaptation of his book, a (very) loosely autobiographical work about his struggles with alcoholism. The Jack Torrance character, played by Jack Nicholson in the movie, provides the book&rsquo;s central point of view, struggling, in the early chapters, to overcome his own demons and earning a last-act redemption.</p><p>The film doesn&rsquo;t have nearly as much sympathy for Jack. Seen from the outside, minus the character&rsquo;s internal monologue, he&rsquo;s a mere bully and an abuser. It&rsquo;s fair that Stephen King was disappointed in the depiction of a character who so closely reflected his own struggles, but the film isn&rsquo;t trying to be the story of a man driven off the deep end by trauma and substance abuse (and maybe ghosts); it&rsquo;s about what happens to an asshole when he finds himself untethered from society&rsquo;s constraints. It&rsquo;s true that he doesn&rsquo;t have much of a character arc, but that&rsquo;s by design: He&rsquo;s a bastard. The horror is faced by the ones who have to live with him.</p><p><strong>Where to stream:</strong> Shudder, AMC+, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/8BgER?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Digital%20rental&amp;short_url=8BgER&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Digital rental</a></p><hr><h2><em>Barbie</em> (2023)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-pBk4NYhWNMM\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Even many of <em>Barbie</em>'s biggest fans see it as an exclusively pro-feminist film&mdash;and it certainly is that, but the message here is a bit more complex. Margot Robbie's Barbie goes on a journey of self-discovery into the real world, discovering the ways in which she's been stifled and limited by the world's expectations of a beautiful doll, while Ryan Gosling's Ken discovers a world of male privilege and toxic masculinity. Many perceived an anti-male message, but the movie sets both characters on the same journey: Both Barbie and Ken realize that they've been limited by cultural norms; experiment with breaking those norms with mixed results; and gradually discover that their best selves have little to do with what's expected of them. Without discounting the movie's feminist messages, it's key that the two characters start and arrive at very similar places&mdash;it's all about being yourself.</p><p><strong>Where to stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/weeKx?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Max&amp;short_url=weeKx&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Max</a>, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/b1Xjw?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Digital%20rental&amp;short_url=b1Xjw&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Digital rental</a></p><hr><h2><em>A.I.

The late director was notorious for his attention to detail; he acquired the rights to Brian Aldiss&rsquo; 1969 short story &ldquo;Supertoys Last All Summer Long&rdquo; in the early 1970s with an eye toward making a film version that he continued developing right up until his death in 1999. The director had considered some sort of collaboration with Steven Spielberg on the project in the early 1990s that never came to be, so it was with the full support of Kubrick&rsquo;s heirs that Spielberg returned to it, penning a script based on a Kubrick-commissioned treatment from writer Ian Watson. The result was a fascinating blend of styles that lead audiences and critics to wonder how much of the movie belonged to each director.</p><p>One bit that was debated at the time is the fairy tale ending involving Haley Joel Osment&rsquo;s robot child David finally getting to experience one final day with his human mother, Monica (Frances O&rsquo;Connor) in the far future. Some audiences thought that the mysterious beings who made the reunion possible were aliens, and therefore likely a Spielberg addition (the director having a known penchant for friendly extraterrestrials, especially before <em>War of the Worlds</em>). But no! They&rsquo;re not aliens, but highly advanced robots. Moreover, the seemingly happy ending is actually incredibly bleak&mdash;David hardly becomes the &ldquo;real boy&rdquo; he sought to be, and his affection is revealed to be only programming, satisfied as it is by a recreated, utterly false version of his &ldquo;mother.&rdquo; Dark stuff&mdash;and pure Kubrick, if filtered through the gauze of Spielberg.</p><p><strong>Where to stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/weeKx?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Paramount%2B&amp;short_url=weeKx&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Paramount+</a>, MGM+, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/3degM?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Digital%20rental&amp;short_url=3degM&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Digital rental</a></p><hr><h2><em>American Psycho</em> (2000)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-Ruw9fsh3PNY\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Most audiences, I think, got it, but <em>American Psycho</em> came in for plenty of early criticism among viewers and critics who found its ultra-male ultra-violence not only off-putting, but offensive. Those interpretations are complicated by the fact that the film is based on a book by Bret Easton Ellis, a not-entirely uncontroversial figure in his own right.

Though screenwriter Diablo Cody mostly avoided the discourse around the topic, allowing the film to speak for itself, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/juno-movie-15-years-later-diablo-cody-roe-1235178240/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">she's been clear </a>that she's emphatically pro-choice, and that the decision was intended as precisely that: a <em>decision</em> that Juno did and ought to have had the right to make.</p><p><strong>Where to stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/2eemW?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Hulu&amp;short_url=2eemW&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Hulu</a></p><hr><h2><em>It's a Wonderful Life</em> (1946)</h2><div class=\"mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl\">\n    <div id=\"video-container-SG9PubuwDH8\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>American's favorite feel-good Christmas movie has surely always been the sort of wam and fuzzy experience that families could gather for sans controversy? Not quite. The movie was pretty much a bomb on its initial release, not really clicking with audiences until television airings many years later. Its rather shockingly dark undertones aside (very few family classics turn on a near-death by suicide), the movie was also a problem for the Feds. Though conservative Republican Frank Capra was hardly known for his lefty leanings, <em>It's a Wonderful Life</em> came under scrutiny for what it saw as the film's mistreatment of poor, maligned Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore). A field agent <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/fbi-red-scare-hollywood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">reported to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover thusly</a>:</p><blockquote><p>With regard to the picture &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life,&rsquo; [an informant] stated in substance that the film represented rather obvious attempts to discredit bankers by casting Lionel Barrymore as a &lsquo;scrooge-type&rsquo; so that he would be the most hated man in the picture. This, according to these sources, is a common trick used by Communists.</p></blockquote><p>The report continues by rather hilariously suggesting that Mr. Potter was simply a conscientious banker just doing his job, and ought to have been treated as such (I'm waiting on the edit of this movie where George Bailey is the villain). So there you have it: what you thought was a Christmas classic safe for the family is, in fact, an insidious Communist tract.

Stanley Kubrick himself gave a pretty good, straightforward synopsis in a <a href=\"https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/movies/stanley-kubrick-interview-joseph-gelmis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">1969 interview</a> with film journalist Joseph Gelmis.

It&rsquo;s understandable: the story of real-life Christopher McCandless (aka Alexander Supertramp) finds the adventurer, having grown disenchanted with modern American society, setting off into the wilderness. Who can&rsquo;t relate to the desire to escape? But McCandless, never entirely prepared for his journey, wound up dying out in the wilderness at only 24 years old. The film finds him coming to the realization, too late, that escape from the problems of the world have left him without any meaningful human connections, which are vital to survival.

At the time of its release (when it made zero dollars), critics and viewers alike generally missed all of that, with the film&rsquo;s <em>non-stop </em>product placement coming under particular scrutiny.

In many ways, it&rsquo;s a transitional movie that bridges the early, more existentially terrifying Freddy with the wise-cracking trickster of later films; here Mr. Krueger is working his way out of the dream world and into reality via hormonal teenager Jessie (Mark Patton). That allows for some impressive body horror, but also ties in with the film&rsquo;s queer subtext. The often sweaty, often shirtless Jessie flees from his girlfriend into the arms of his best friend, Ron. He encounters his coach at a gay bar; later, that coach is essentially spanked to death by Freddy in the showers. <br><br>This was all assumed to have been unintentional camp, but the stars (Patton and Robert Englund) as well as writer David Chaskin have all made clear in the years since that they, at least, knew exactly what they were doing, and the queer subtext was definitely the point.

If not a sex worker, precisely, Holly Golightly is still a woman paid handsomely by the men she keeps company with; she&rsquo;s also still a one-time child bride who was a stepmother to four children as a teenager. The movie&rsquo;s pop culture reputation leaves much of that out, but there&rsquo;s quite a bit more darkness and complexity onscreen than the famous Audrey Hepburn poster lets on.

She&rsquo;s at the center of the film&rsquo;s love triangle, no question, but the screenplay also knocks her down a peg or two: The actress whose power made her popular in the early &lsquo;30s had failed to connect with the more conservative audiences of later in the decade, and so <em>Philadelphia Story</em> saw her Tracy Lord character doubting herself and coming to understand that her perfection and power are threatening to men and aren&rsquo;t doing her any good. <br><br>It&rsquo;s all perfectly calibrated to boost Hepburn&rsquo;s appeal without completely ditching the sass and strength that had made her a star initially&mdash;and it was all very much by design. The original play was written for Hepburn, who provided the financial backing to get the thing off the ground. When the show did well, she acquired the rights and sold them to MGM, gaining veto power over almost every significant aspect of the production in the process. It was a hit, and also a bit of sleight-of-hand: The movie that wound up softening Hepburn&rsquo;s image was, in reality, one of the biggest power moves in Hollywood history.</p><p><strong>Where to stream:</strong> MGM+, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/NM0ed?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Digital%20rental&amp;short_url=NM0ed&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Digital rental</a></p>"

Constantly going in and out of the house and leaving windows open leads to house flies and mosquitos, and the part of the country I live in is under ceaseless attack by sugar ants that infiltrate your home absolutely everywhere. The produce and fruit that is in abundance and tends to sit on your counter can often lead to fruit flies.

The upside is that the bugs it catches are well hidden from sight, and the trap subdues how purple the light looks, so it&rsquo;s really just an innocuous light you don&rsquo;t notice much. All the while, it is great for flying insects. Every few years they skip spraying for mosquitoes here, and last year was particularly bad.

It&rsquo;s a sticky gel, and you don&rsquo;t want kids or pets eating it, so it's a good idea to use <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/W0vWA?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Roundups&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=traps&amp;short_url=W0vWA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>traps</u></a>. It's a good way to get some long-term relief, if you stay consistent&mdash;but it takes time. The ants swarm the Terro, and then bring it back to their queen, and then the poison kicks in and they all die. But if you want immediate relief, <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/Ad3k7?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Roundups&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Zevo%E2%80%99s%20Flying%20Insect%20Spray&amp;short_url=Ad3k7&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Zevo&rsquo;s Flying Insect Spray</u></a> is shockingly effective. It&rsquo;s pet and kid safe, and smells like mint. Though it&rsquo;s technically labeled for flies, roaches and ants, I never tried it on anything but ants, and a light spray will kill the ants on contact and buy you a day or two without return. In particular, I use it around my dog&rsquo;s food station and my sink.&nbsp;</p><h2>Upgrade your DIY fruit fly traps </h2><p>Everyone knows you can just wrap a dish of vinegar with plastic wrap, poke some small holes with a skewer and wait for the fruit flies to fly in and drown in the vinegar. The system is imperfect, because you can see the dead fruit flies and if you make the holes too big, they can just fly back out. Last year I tried these commercial <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/rdY6m?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Roundups&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=fruit%20fly%20traps&amp;short_url=rdY6m&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>fruit fly traps</u></a>, which are just a manufactured version of the DIY home trap. They look like little red plastic apples. They&rsquo;re in two parts, so you can dump and refill the vinegar every few days, and they&rsquo;re small and unintrusive. The holes are exactly the right size, and the plastic hides the death pool within. Toss them in the dishwasher when the problem is gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

They typically cost more than standard flagships, but do they offer enough to justify that extra cost?</p><p>The answer can be yes&mdash;but not for everyone. Before you decide to put down a significant amount of money for a foldable phone, you need to be sure you're going to get enough out of it. What follows are use cases where a foldable phone really can make a difference, and if they make sense to you, a folding phone could be your next upgrade.</p><p>This list focuses mainly on book-style foldables&mdash;the likes of the Galaxy Z Fold 5, the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/new-ai-features-the-pixel-fold-and-more-updates-from-1850424583\" target=\"_blank\">Google Pixel Fold</a>, and the OnePlus Open&mdash;but there is a mention of flip foldables, such as the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-differences-between-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-and-1850782228\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> and the Motorola Razr, at the end.</p><h2>Improved multitasking</h2><p>This is one of the more obvious ones: With a screen double the size of a typical phone display, you can very easily get one app up alongside another. Whether that's actually useful depends on the specific apps you're going to be spending most of your time in&mdash;you don't get a whole lot of room on each side, so it can feel a bit cramped at times.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1VP60QZQ9R29J965Q9X4V2C/images-1.fill.size_705x750.v1719989895.jpg\" alt=\"Foldable multitasking\" width=\"705\" height=\"750\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1VP60QZQ9R29J965Q9X4V2C/images-1.fill.size_800x851.v1719989895.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1VP60QZQ9R29J965Q9X4V2C/images-1.fill.size_1400x1490.v1719989895.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1VP60QZQ9R29J965Q9X4V2C/images-1.fill.size_2000x2128.v1719989895.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\">Get apps alongside each other.</span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Lifehacker</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Bear in mind you can split the screen vertically as well as horizontally. It's great for watching videos while checking your email, or looking up articles on the web while also making notes, or keeping an eye on social media while you also update your calendar. Over time, you'll most likely come up with useful split-screen combinations of your own.</p><h2>Watching videos</h2><p>A foldable phone gives you a screen that approaches mini-tablet size when open, and that means videos play at a significantly larger size. There can be some heavy letterboxing, but the extra screen space top and bottom can come in handy too&mdash;it means you can watch YouTube clips while also flicking through the comments below the clip, for instance.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1VP60QZQ9R29J965Q9X4V2C/images-2.fill.size_705x750.v1719989895.jpg\" alt=\"Foldable video\" width=\"705\" height=\"750\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1VP60QZQ9R29J965Q9X4V2C/images-2.fill.size_800x851.v1719989895.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1VP60QZQ9R29J965Q9X4V2C/images-2.fill.size_1400x1490.v1719989895.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1VP60QZQ9R29J965Q9X4V2C/images-2.fill.size_2000x2128.v1719989895.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\">Watch videos with the comments.</span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Lifehacker</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The previous tip mentioned watching videos in split-screen mode, and if you use your phone half-folded, it means you've got a video screen propped up for easy viewing (like having a kickstand on your phone, without the kickstand). The lower half of the screen can be repurposed for displaying comments or playback controls for what you're watching.</p><h2>Playing games</h2><p>Another scenario where all that extra screen space can come in handy is with games. Most Android titles will happily expand to fill the extra space without any problem, and that means you can see more of the game setting: racetrack, space station, dungeon, or whatever it is. It's great for everything from basic puzzle games to open-world adventures.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1VP60QZQ9R29J965Q9X4V2C/images-3.fill.size_705x750.v1719989895.jpg\" alt=\"Foldable gaming\" width=\"705\" height=\"750\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1VP60QZQ9R29J965Q9X4V2C/images-3.fill.size_800x851.v1719989895.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1VP60QZQ9R29J965Q9X4V2C/images-3.fill.size_1400x1490.v1719989895.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1VP60QZQ9R29J965Q9X4V2C/images-3.fill.size_2000x2128.v1719989895.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\">Look at all that screen space...</span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Lifehacker</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>The controls can often be easier to use as well, though this can vary from game to game.

						"__cdata": "<p>A few weeks ago, British teenager Jay Slater went missing in the Costa del Sol region of Spain, spurring international interest in the case and a deluge of speculation and conspiracy theories about the mysterious disappearance. But how much of a mystery is it really?</p><p>Here are the facts that are publicly known:</p><p>On the morning of June 17, 2024, Slater attended the NRG Music Festival on the island of Tenerife, Spain. After the show, he missed his bus, so he went to the mountain village of Masca with two men he met at the festival. In the morning, Slater set out to walk the 10 miles back to his accommodations. He called his sister 50 minutes after leaving and said he was \"in the middle of nowhere,\" his phone batteries were almost dead, and he had no water. That was the last time anyone heard from him. After a widespread manhunt, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpe3nwn5d7wo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">authorities called off the search </a>on June 30, but are continuing to investigate the case.</p><h2>When is a disappearance a mystery?</h2><p>I love a mystery, and there's an appealing \"<em>anything</em> could have happened\" aspect to disappearances like Slater's. The unknown gets people's gears spinning&mdash;maybe he was kidnapped? Maybe the two men Slater met that night aren't innocent witnesses? Maybe it was part of some greater, sinister conspiracy? Maybe aliens got him?</p><p>People filling in the blanks of an unknown situation is to be expected, but all available evidence points to a tragic but mundane explanation: Slater got lost in the wilderness, died, and his body hasn't been found. The mountainous region he was walking is dotted with cliffs, sharp rocks, rivers, and waterfalls. He was unfamiliar with the terrain. He was near the ocean&mdash;there are countless ways to die that don't require aliens. The Spanish authorities seem to agree; they're <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/jay-slater-disappearance-not-being-treated-as-a-crime-say-spanish-authorities/ar-BB1pdhmL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">not treating the disappearance like a crime any longer</a>. </p><h2>Mysterious disappearance culture</h2><p>But maybe the authorities are <em>in</em> <em>on it</em>&mdash;is the kind of thing people say within the thriving online infrastructure dedicated to unsolved disappearances. One of the most visible and silly expressions of it is <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/W0vPn?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Opinions&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Missing%20411&amp;short_url=W0vPn&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><em>Missing 411</em></a>, a book that illustrates how far people will go to reject logical explanations. <em>Missing 411</em> proposes that there's something mysterious and/or nefarious about \"clusters\" of people who go missing in and around US national parks and are never found. Because \"a lot of people travel to national parks where they get lost and die, and we don't find their bodies because nature is big.\" isn't an adequate enough explanation. </p><p>If you ignore the most likely cause of disappearances, you can come up with all sorts of theories, and man, people have some <em>theories</em>. Some examples from the Slater case: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@unsettling.mysteries/photo/7382623347286248736\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">this video with 3 million views</a> that confidently states \"People don't just disappear\" (sometimes, they do, as we can see here), <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@rhiannaroberts.xo/photo/7382365745805528352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">this video</a>, with 8.3 million views, that offers random shapes in Google street view as evidence that is was all a set-up and he wasn't actually there at all, or <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@officiallnedprimrose/video/7383403980996611360\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">this video</a> (6.7 million views) that proclaims Jay Slater has already been found.</p><h2>What's the harm in playing detective?</h2><p>The overwhelming majority of amateur sleuths out there aren't doing any harm. They're fighting the drudgery of their lives through mental side-trips into the darkness&mdash;everyone likes true crime, right? But there is a subset of cranks who get <em>involved</em>, who screw up legitimate police investigations, or even worse, target families with missing children for their own ends.</p><p>In the Slater case (and in other high-profile cases), these people tend to fall into two camps: presumably well-meaning folks who are seeking out the family because they really believe that their crackpot theory will result in Slater returning home safely, and bottom-feeders who are trying to profit off the situation by trying to make themselves a part of the story or through actual crimes.</p><p>Members of the (charitably speaking) well-meaning contingent have publicly suggested Slater ran afoul of Moroccan drug gangs, that it's all a scam to raise social media money, that the mafia was involved, and a thousand other unlikely scenarios. </p><p>According to Slater's mother, Debbie Duncan, the online conspiracy theorists are making the investigation harder. \"They have actually said that there&rsquo;s too much noise, that&rsquo;s affecting it,&rdquo; she told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/26/jay-slater-family-fear-online-noise-may-impede-tenerife-search-mission\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><em>The Guardian</em></a>. </p><p>Slater's employer is <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/jay-slaters-employer-urges-people-to-stop-sending-them-cruel-emails-13159709\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">imploring people</a> to stop messing around, too. \"These people are trying to ruin people's lives and businesses (while) sat behind a screen looking for attention,\" a post on the company's Facebook page reads. \"Everyone may have their own theories and feelings but to publicly post them knowing you are going to hurt people is just cruel.\"</p><h2>A lone-wolf mountain climber enters the chat</h2><p>Shut-ins offering opinions, dime-store <a href=\"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/sicko-medium-demanded-flights-tenerife-33068345\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">psychics</a>, and fake <a href=\"https://www.gbnews.com/news/jay-slater-family-fake-ransom-demands-madeleine-mccann-investigator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">ransom demands</a> from ghouls are depressing, but totally expected in these situations. But there are also people like Paul Arnott. The British climber and TikTok content creator traveled to Spain to aid in the search immediately after Slater went missing. He then quit the official manhunt, publicly calling it a PR stunt. Now he's doing his own investigation on his <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@downtherapids\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">TikTok channel</a> that's being watched by millions. Maybe he's a well-meaning guy trying to help. Maybe he's trying to raise his personal profile through his association with the case. Maybe it's somewhere in the middle. Right now, the coin is in the air, so there is still the possibility (a very small one, if you ask me) that something other than \"got lost and died\" happened to Jay Slater. But if this guy, or any other \"internet investigator\" cracks the case, I'll literally eat my hat.</p>"

The World Cup champions Argentina managed to win all of their games from their group and finish first in Group A. Ecuador, on the other hand, finished second in Group B after losing to Venezuela and tying with Mexico. However, the Ecuadorians are still a strong team currently in fifth place in the World Cup qualifiers. Argentina should still be able to win, but it won't be as easy as their Group A games.</p><p>To watch the game for free, head over to Sportitallia, who are streaming all of the Copa America matches for free in Italy.

It's integrated into Google Drive, it's feature-rich, and it makes it dead easy to collaborate with others. But, Proton is&mdash;once again&mdash;pushing its way in on Google&rsquo;s turf with a new privacy-focused alternative thanks to today&rsquo;s launch of Docs in Proton Drive.</p><p>According to the <a href=\"http://proton.me/blog/docs-proton-drive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">launch announcement</a>, Docs in Proton Drive will allow users to take full advantage of many of the same collaborative features that make Google Docs so enticing, all while offering better privacy features, including end-to-end encryption on all your documents. This should make Docs in Proton Drive a welcome option for those who are working with more sensitive information, both at work and home.</p><p>The main features available with Docs in Proton Drive include rich text editing, with the ability to create and edit documents using a variety of formatting options, as well as file compatibility for multiple formats, including Microsoft&rsquo;s .docx. In other words, it should seamlessly integrate with any work you might already have in other programs. Proton also says that you&rsquo;ll be able to add comments, reply to them, and even mark them as resolved to help create a collaborative environment.</p><div class=\"eloquent-imagery-image\">\n    <div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n                    <img class=\"border border-gray-100\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1T8CW9F5QP8S799NA3QA822/images-1.fill.size_2000x1000.v1719941886.png\" alt=\"Collaboration in Docs in Proton Drive\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1T8CW9F5QP8S799NA3QA822/images-1.fill.size_800x400.v1719941886.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1T8CW9F5QP8S799NA3QA822/images-1.fill.size_1400x700.v1719941886.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1T8CW9F5QP8S799NA3QA822/images-1.fill.size_2000x1000.v1719941886.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"mt-2\">\n                            <span class=\"mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide\"></span>\n                                        <span class=\"text-xs inline-block text-gray-600\">Credit: Proton</span>\n                    </div>\n    </div>\n<p>Docs in Proton Drive will also support the option to embed images and invite various collaborators, though they will need at least a free Proton account so the company can ensure the secure environment remains intact. Further, you&rsquo;ll be able to see who is viewing the document, as well as where they are working, using similar collaborative cursors to what's in Google Docs.</p><p>The launch of Docs in Proton Drive builds off <a href=\"https://proton.me/blog/proton-standard-notes-join-forces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Proton&rsquo;s recent acquisition of Standard Notes</a>, an encrypted notes app. The company considers it a major milestone in the ongoing development of the Proton ecosystem, and it says that Docs will offer full support for markdown, code blocks, checklists, and more at launch.</p><p>These are all features already present in Google Docs, which is what makes it such an enticing option for collaborators. By offering such a high level of parity at launch, Proton is ensuring a strong start for Docs in Proton Drive, ensuring users who wish to leave Google Docs behind won't lose out on any of the necessary features they already relying on.</p>"

We&rsquo;ll share some clues, tips, and strategies, and finally the solution. Today&rsquo;s puzzle is easier; I got it in three. <strong>Beware, there are spoilers below for July 3, Wordle #1,110!</strong> Keep scrolling if you want some hints (and then the answer) to today&rsquo;s Wordle game.</p><h2>How to play Wordle</h2><p>Wordle lives <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>here on the New York Times website</u></a>. A new puzzle goes live every day at midnight, your local time.</p><p>Start by guessing a five-letter word. The letters of the word will turn green if they&rsquo;re correct, yellow if you have the right letter in the wrong place, or gray if the letter isn&rsquo;t in the day&rsquo;s secret word at all. For more, check out <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-master-or-cheat-at-wordle-the-internets-favor-1848312354\" target=\"_blank\"><u>our guide to playing Wordle here</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-lost-wordle-today-1850348061\" target=\"_blank\"><u>my strategy guide here for more advanced tips</u></a>. (We also have more information at the bottom of this post, after the hints and answers.)</p><p>Ready for the hints? Let&rsquo;s go!</p><hr><h2>Does today&rsquo;s Wordle have any unusual letters?</h2><p>We&rsquo;ll define common letters as those that appear in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etaoin_shrdlu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>old typesetters&rsquo; phrase</u></a> ETAOIN SHRDLU. (Memorize this! Pronounce it &ldquo;Edwin Shirdloo,&rdquo; like a name, and pretend he&rsquo;s a friend of yours.)</p><p>Four of today's letters are from our mnemonic. The other is fairly common.</p><h2>Can you give me a hint for today&rsquo;s Wordle?</h2><p>This is a lower body part, colloquially.  </p><h2>Does today&rsquo;s Wordle have any double or repeated letters?</h2><p>There is one repeated letter today.&nbsp;</p><h2>How many vowels are in today&rsquo;s Wordle?</h2><p>There is one vowel. </p><h2>What letter does today&rsquo;s Wordle start with?</h2><p>Today&rsquo;s word starts with T.&nbsp;</p><h2>What letter does today&rsquo;s Wordle end with?</h2><p>Today&rsquo;s word ends with H.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is the solution to today&rsquo;s Wordle?</h2><p>Ready? Today&rsquo;s word is THIGH.</p><h2>How I solved today&rsquo;s Wordle</h2><p>I started with RAISE and TOUCH, which left only two possible solutions&mdash;and I guessed THIGH first as the more common word.        </p><pre class=\"border-2 border-gray-400 bg-gray-100 p-4 text-black shadow-md\">Wordle 1,110 3/6\n\n&#11035;&#11035;&#129001;&#11035;&#11035;\n&#129001;&#11035;&#11035;&#11035;&#129001;\n&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;&#129001;</pre>\n<hr><h2>Yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle answer</h2><p>Yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle was harder. The hint was &ldquo;can be made of ivory or gold and embedded&rdquo; and the answer contained four common letters and one uncommon letter. </p><p>The answer to yesterday&rsquo;s Wordle was INLAY. </p><h2>A primer on Wordle basics</h2><p>The idea of Wordle is to guess the day&rsquo;s secret word. When you first open the Wordle game, you&rsquo;ll see an empty grid of letters. It&rsquo;s up to <em>you</em> to make the first move: type in any five-letter word.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, you can use the colors that are revealed to get clues about the word:&nbsp;<strong>Green</strong> means you correctly guessed a letter, and it&rsquo;s in the correct position. (For example, if you guess PARTY, and the word is actually PURSE, the P and R will be green.)</p><ul><li><p><strong>Yellow</strong> means the letter is somewhere in the word, but not in the position you guessed it. (For example, if you guessed PARTY, but the word is actually ROAST, the R, A and T will all be yellow.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Gray</strong> means the letter is not in the solution word at all. (If you guessed PARTY and everything is gray, then the solution <em>cannot</em> be PURSE or ROAST.)</p></li></ul><p>With all that in mind, guess another word, and then another, trying to land on the correct word before you run out of chances. You get six guesses, and then it&rsquo;s game over.</p><h2>The best starter words for Wordle</h2><p>What should you play for that first guess? The best starters tend to contain common letters, to increase the chances of getting yellow and green squares to guide your guessing. (And if you get all grays when guessing common letters, that&rsquo;s <em>still</em> excellent information to help you rule out possibilities.) There isn&rsquo;t a single &ldquo;best&rdquo; starting word, but the New York Times&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/this-bot-can-tell-you-how-good-you-really-are-at-wordle-1848769075\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Wordle analysis bot</u></a> has suggested starting with one of these:</p><ul><li><p>CRANE</p></li><li><p>TRACE</p></li><li><p>SLANT</p></li><li><p>CRATE</p></li><li><p>CARTE</p></li></ul><p>Meanwhile, an MIT analysis <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/science-thinks-it-has-found-the-best-wordle-starter-1849541276\" target=\"_blank\"><u>found</u></a> that you&rsquo;ll eliminate the most possibilities in the first round by starting with one of these:</p><ul><li><p>SALET</p></li><li><p>REAST</p></li><li><p>TRACE</p></li><li><p>CRATE</p></li><li><p>SLATE</p></li></ul><p>Other good picks might be ARISE or ROUND. Words like ADIEU and AUDIO get more vowels in play, but you could argue that it&rsquo;s better to start with an emphasis on consonants, using a starter like RENTS or CLAMP. Choose your strategy, and see how it plays out.</p><h2>How to win at Wordle</h2><p>We have a few guides to Wordle strategy, which you might like to read over if you&rsquo;re a serious student of the game. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-win-at-wordle-according-to-my-wife-1848480285\" target=\"_blank\"><u>This one</u></a> covers how to use consonants to your advantage, while <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-master-or-cheat-at-wordle-the-internets-favor-1848312354\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this one</u></a> focuses on a strategy that uses the most common letters. In <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/you-should-try-quordle-if-youre-too-good-at-wordle-1848540319\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this advanced guide</u></a>, we detail a three-pronged approach for fishing for hints while maximizing your chances of winning quickly.</p><p>The biggest thing that separates Wordle winners from Wordle losers is that winners <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-you-lost-wordle-today-1850348061\" target=\"_blank\"><u>use their guesses to gather information about what letters are in the word</u></a>. If you know that the word must end in -OUND, don&rsquo;t waste four guesses on MOUND, ROUND, SOUND, and HOUND; combine those consonants and guess MARSH. If the H lights up in yellow, you know the solution.</p><p>One more note on strategy: the original Wordle used a list of about 2,300 solution words, but after the game was bought by the NYT, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/wordle-has-themes-now-so-you-should-change-your-strate-1849840529\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the game now has an editor who hand-picks the solutions</u></a>. Sometimes they are slightly tricky words that wouldn&rsquo;t have made the original list, and sometimes they are topical. For example, FEAST was the solution one Thanksgiving. So keep in mind that there may be a theme.</p><h2>Wordle alternatives</h2><p>If you can&rsquo;t get enough of five-letter guessing games and their kin, the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-10-best-wordle-alternatives-ranked-by-difficulty-1848859009\" target=\"_blank\"><u>best Wordle alternatives</u></a>, ranked by difficulty, include:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://wheelsrpgs.itch.io/wheeldle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Wheeldle, which lets you play one puzzle after another</u></a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://zaratustra.itch.io/dordle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Dordle</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/games/quordle/#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"><u>Quordle</u></a>, which ask you to play two (Dordle) or four (Quordle) puzzles at the same time, with the same guesses.

Plus, it frees up space on the desk that you can use for other things, like the organizational tools below. </p><p>You really only need something simple, so try something like this:</p><div class=\"mb-4 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6\">\n    <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/OdoB2?pageview_type=Standard&amp;template=Roundups&amp;module=content-body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=whole-shop-card&amp;element_label=Nulaxy%20Laptop%20Stand%2C%20Detachable%20Ergonomic%20Laptop%20Mount&amp;short_url=OdoB2&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" data-commerce=\"1\" target=\"_blank\" data-parent-group=\"affiliate-link\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\" class=\"cursor-default no-underline\" data-ga-click=\"data-ga-click\" data-ga-item=\"whole-shop-card\" data-ga-label=\"Nulaxy Laptop Stand, Detachable Ergonomic Laptop Mount\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap justify-between px-7 text-black no-underline md:flex-nowrap md:px-8\">\n            <div class=\"order-1 mx-auto flex flex-col justify-center md:order-2 md:ml-4 md:w-full md:grow\">\n                <div class=\"block cursor-pointer text-center font-akshar text-2xl font-medium leading-7 text-brand-green duration-200 ease-in-out hover:text-brand-green-700 md:text-left md:text-xl md:leading-6\">Nulaxy Laptop Stand, Detachable Ergonomic Laptop Mount\n                </div>\n                                <div class=\"mt-4 hidden md:flex md:justify-between\">\n                                            <div class=\"self-end\">\n                            <div class=\"mb-0 h-11 md:flex md:flex-col md:justify-center\"><div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $15.99\n                            <span class=\"font-medium\">at Amazon</span>\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"w-44 self-end\">\n                            <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Shop Now\n</button>\n                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 mt-5 h-auto w-full md:order-1 md:mt-0 md:hidden\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1THD39JEQ93DRWZNNKCXD6J/images-1.fill.size_autoxauto.v1719951330.jpg\" alt=\"Nulaxy Laptop Stand, Detachable Ergonomic Laptop Mount\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-2 ml-2 hidden w-32 shrink-0 items-center md:order-1 md:ml-0 md:flex\">\n                <div class=\"flex aspect-video items-center justify-center\">\n                                            <img class=\"m-0 max-h-full max-w-full rounded-md\" src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01J1THD39JEQ93DRWZNNKCXD6J/images-1.fill.size_autoxauto.v1719951330.jpg\" alt=\"Nulaxy Laptop Stand, Detachable Ergonomic Laptop Mount\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"lazy\">\n                                    </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"order-3 flex grow flex-wrap md:hidden md:grow-0\">\n                                    <div class=\"mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <button class=\"flex justify-center items-center w-full bg-brand-green text-white text-base font-sans font-medium rounded-md hover:bg-brand-green-700 hover:cursor-pointer md:text-sm h-11\">\n    Shop Now\n</button>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"mx-2 mt-4 w-full\">\n                        <div class=\" font-sans leading-4 text-black\">\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-1 md:justify-start\">\n        <span class=\"font-bold\">\n            $15.99\n                            <span class=\"font-medium\">at Amazon</span>\n                    </span>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n</a></div>\n<h2>Your desk also needs (a lot of) storage</h2><p>Next, it's time to overhaul your storage situation.

It's distracting and draining to see a mess all day and it makes it harder to access the tools you need to get your work done. </p><p>Organizing that desk can help you be more productive, so use <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/best-decluttering-methods\" target=\"_blank\">a decluttering method</a> to get rid of anything you don't need. Then, follow the rules of the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/use-the-organizational-triangle-to-declutter\" target=\"_blank\">Organizational Triangle</a>, specifically the ones that dictate that everything you own must have a designated storage space and must be stored with similar objects.</p><p>A major component of doing all that is having the right kind of storage boxes and solutions at hand. For a desk, you need small containers that will hold various office supplies.

I know I feel lazy when I work in darker environments, which is why I am such a big proponent of <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/the-best-desk-lamps-under-40\" target=\"_blank\">having little lamps all over</a>.</p><p>Since our goal here is to organize your space and make it more productive, try this lamp, which has storage compartments in its base that are perfect for holding sticky notes, pens, and other small objects.

It all needs some help to prevent the formation of a rat's nest of cords. </p><p>I swear by the Smartish magnetic cord holder. It looks kind of like a rock, but it's actually a big magnet. You can just toss your charging cords over it and they'll stay in place.

The individual ones are better than the long, multi-slot ones because you can arrange them in a way that makes sense based on your personal desk setup.

those little compartments and drawers.

Sometimes, you're just working for too long and you don't feel like doing that. A mini can will get the trash off your desk right away, keeping it clean so you can focus on work.

You can decide whether or not the application launches at login, and opt to only show the menu bar icon when your computer is offline (handy if you're trying to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/ice-menu-bar-app-best-bartender-alternative\" target=\"_blank\">free up space on your menu bar)</a>.

						"__cdata": "<p>Every tech product you own has a post-release &ldquo;lifespan.&rdquo; For example, <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772#:~:text=Products%20are%20considered%20vintage%20when,less%20than%207%20years%20ago.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Apple&rsquo;s policies guarantee five years of support</a>, starting from a device&rsquo;s release date (as opposed to whenever you bought it). Once those five years are up, Apple can deem that device &ldquo;vintage.\" </p><p>In fact, Apple recently classified three of its products as vintage: the iPhone X (2017), first-generation AirPods (2016), and the first-generation HomePod (2017). That might come as news to you, if you're still using one or more of these products yourself. </p><p>With that in mind, what exactly does it mean for an Apple product to go &ldquo;vintage,\" and what happens when a vintage product goes &ldquo;obsolete?&rdquo;</p><h2>Vintage Apple products</h2><p>\"Vintage\" in Apple land doesn't actually mean a product is \"old,\" or that you should stop using it&mdash;nor does it imply you'll be able to sell it to collectors for a profit. When an Apple device becomes &ldquo;vintage,&rdquo; that product is no longer guaranteed by Apple to be repairable at an Apple Store or authorized service provider. In many cases, Apple will also stop issuing the device routine software updates.</p><p>Despite the reduction in support, vintage Apple devices will still work (this isn&rsquo;t some sort of internal kill switch) and some devices may even receive occasional system updates if they support the latest operating systems or if a major security flaw needs to be patched. It&rsquo;s even<em> </em>possible you could get one repaired, if the parts are available. Just don't be surprised if an Apple Genius or an Apple-authorized vendor turns you away.</p><p>Apple doesn't automatically deem a product as vintage five years after the original sale date. Take a look at the newest products on the list: The iPhone X could have been made vintage in 2022, but Apple waited an extra year and a half. Apple's official definition of \"vintage\" is a product that is more than five years old, but fewer than seven. AirPods are seven years old exactly, so they're coming in <em>right</em> at the cutoff. (A list of all vintage and obsolete devices can be found on <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">Apple&rsquo;s support site</a>.)</p><p>However, once a product is more than seven years old, it graduates to a different category: &ldquo;Obsolete.&rdquo;</p><h2>Apple&rsquo;s \"obsolete\" list</h2><p>Like vintage products, devices listed as &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; will operate as normal as long as the hardware is in working condition. However, obsolete products lose virtually all hardware support. The only exception is MacBooks, which may allow for a battery replacement up to 10 years after the product was last available for sale. </p><p>An obsolete device, however, may still receive some software support. Don't expect <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/subtle-and-hidden-features-and-changes-in-ios-18\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 18</a> on an obsolete iPhone, mind you. But Apple <em>did</em> release a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">security update for iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus back in March</a>, both of which are obsolete. </p><p>These shifts in service priority can be frustrating if you&rsquo;re still rocking older tech and don&rsquo;t feel like upgrading, but the policy makes sense given the current market realities: At the rate that both hardware and software iterate, diverting resources to keep outdated devices afloat is difficult and costly. However, even if an Apple Store turns your iPhone X away for repair, independent repair shops may still help you out for some time to come&mdash;even when the X eventually becomes \"obsolete.\"</p><p>Just don't expect much repair help with your AirPods: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ahNUjteea8w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">They're largely unrepairable</a>. </p>"

						"__cdata": "<p>Google is set to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/when-google-is-unveiling-next-pixel\" target=\"_blank\">unveil its Pixel 9 lineup of smartphones in August</a>, a full month earlier than usual. Along with new hardware, which, of course, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-9-pink-leak-video\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">has already leaked</a>, the company is likely to reveal new software features for the new Pixel devices, and unsurprisingly, much of that will be AI. Lucky for us, we don't have to wait to learn about some of these features.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-ai-recall-pixel-9-3456399/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">In an exclusive report</a>, Android Authority details new AI features allegedly coming to Pixel 9. Android Authority says a source inside Google provided the outlet with a list of five features the company plans to highlight with the release of its new smartphone this year, via a screenshot titled \"Discover Google AI at its best.\"</p><p>We know about two of these features already. One is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-ai-features#:~:text=Circle%20to%20Search%20is%20a,the%20search%20launches%E2%80%94that's%20it.\" target=\"_blank\">Circle to Search</a>, which, as the name implies, lets you draw a circle around an element on your smartphone's display to start a search on it. The other is <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/googles-new-gemini-ai-app\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini</a>, Google's AI assistant, which you can already <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-make-gemini-your-default-assistant-on-android\" target=\"_blank\">use to replace the traditional Google Assistant</a> on your Pixel if you want to. </p><p>While Google may push these two existing AI features as part of its Pixel 9 launch, there are three new AI features the company may also rollout in tandem with the new smartphone:</p><h2>Add Me</h2><p>According to the alleged screenshot from Google Android Authority shared, \"Add Me\" is a feature that lets you \"make sure everyone's included in a group photo.\" While that isn't particularly descriptive, one can infer that Android will use AI to edit you into a picture if you didn't make it in frame in time.</p><p>That would be a compliment to Google's existing <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/all-the-new-ai-features-coming-to-google-pixel-8-1850899112#:~:text=Best%20Take,include%20in%20the%20final%20option.\" target=\"_blank\">Best Take</a> feature, which, after taking multiple photos of a group of people, lets you choose the \"best\" face of each subject from each photo. </p><p>These are useful features in theory, but they do challenge the idea of the photograph itself: What's really the point of a photo if it doesn't actually represent reality? \"Let's all look at that group photo we took on our trip last year. Although Greg wasn't actually there...and Melissa definitely wasn't looking at the camera...At least we're all smiling!\"</p><h2>Studio</h2><p>\"You imagine it. Pixel creates it.\" That's how Google describes \"Studio\" in Android Authority's screenshot. By the description, it sounds like a built-in AI image generator on your Pixel. That tracks, since Google is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\">building an app called Creative Assistant</a>, primarily for making stickers.</p><p>It's par for the course these days for tech companies to offer AI art generators, so this isn't a surprising development. I'm sure Google will inject some Pixel or Android-specific features with Studio, but for now, this is all we know. </p><h2>Pixel Screenshots</h2><p>It's \"Pixel Screenshots\" that's by far the most interesting new feature outlined here. Based on the screenshots of the feature shared by Android Authority, Pixel Screenshots is essentially <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/microsofts-new-recall-feature-is-equal-parts-cool-and-dangerous\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft's Recall</a> feature, but for the screenshots saved on your Pixel. </p><p>Recall, as you may recall, was designed to save a snapshot of your entire screen every few moments, so you could search for quite literally anything you ever did on your PC. It was met with widespread concern and criticism, especially once it appeared to be quite vulnerable to hacking. <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/microsoft-pulling-recall-from-copilot-at-launch\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft has since delayed the feature's rollout</a>. </p><p>Pixel Screenshots, on the other hand, doesn't seem to take a screenshot of your display every few seconds; rather, it scans your existing screenshots to turn them into a \"searchable library.\" If you know you screenshotted a pair of shoes you wanted to buy, or a receipt you need to reference, you can use the feature to search for it. </p><p>When you turn the feature on, Android will save extra data for screenshots you take going forward, including web links, the names of apps, and the date and time the screenshot was taken, all to make it easier to search for those data points in the future. Interestingly, the feature says all data access and processing happens on-device, so none of your data <em>should</em> make its way to Google's servers.</p><p>On the surface, it sounds much more secure than Microsoft's solution, although it also serves a much different purpose. That said, there's a slight risk to the feature: Allowing AI to make searching screenshots a breeze opens the door for anyone with access to your phone to do the same: If you save screenshots of sensitive information, like credit card numbers, banking info, or passwords, anyone with access to your phone could search for this data.</p><p>That said, Google hasn't actually announced any of these features yet. We'll just have to see which features, if any, the company does decide to bundle with the Pixel 9 when it launches later this year. </p>"

						"__cdata": "<p>The Roth IRA is a top-tier retirement savings tool. For <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-millennials-and-gen-zers-should-be-investing-in-rot-1847753911\" target=\"_blank\"><u>young people especially</u></a>, it&rsquo;s the best way to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/these-numbers-will-convince-your-teen-to-start-saving-f-1850144908\" target=\"_blank\"><u>take full advantage of compound interest</u></a> while minimizing your tax exposure. In the simplest terms, with Roth IRAs, you pay taxes on your savings now. This is compared to traditional IRAs, when you pay taxes later. We&rsquo;ve written about the differences in more detail <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/a-beginner-s-guide-to-opening-an-ira-1607498930\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/why-millennials-and-gen-zers-should-be-investing-in-rot-1847753911\" target=\"_blank\"><u>I generally lean pro-Roth</u></a> over traditional. </p><p>With Trump-era tax cuts set to expire in 2025, now might be a strategic time to take advantage of that \"pay taxes <em>now</em>\" element. Let's explore whether a Roth IRA conversion could be the smart move for you.</p><h2>Why consider a Roth IRA conversion now?</h2><p>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 is set to sunset at the end of 2025, unless Congress extends it. If no action is taken, tax rates would revert to the higher levels of 2017 and earlier. This means that converting to a Roth IRA now, while tax rates are relatively low, could result in significant long-term tax savings. </p><p>Anyone with an existing <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/all-the-different-retirement-accounts-you-can-take-adva-1850950256\" target=\"_blank\">retirement account</a>, such as a 401(k) or traditional IRA, can convert to a Roth IRA. This option is available regardless of income levels, making it an attractive strategy for high-income earners who may not qualify for direct Roth IRA contributions. As always, a major draw of the Roth IRA comes down to<em> future </em>tax-free withdrawals. It's a smart account for anyone who expects to be in a higher tax bracket down the line (which is most people).</p><h2>Is a Roth IRA conversion right for you?</h2><p>Regardless of the 2025 deadline, consider whether a Roth conversion is right for you.</p><p>1. Current vs. expected future tax rates: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth conversion may be beneficial.</p><p>2. Time horizon: The longer you have until retirement, the more time your Roth IRA has to grow tax-free.</p><p>3. Ability to pay taxes: Can you afford to pay the taxes on the conversion without using funds from the retirement account itself?</p><p>4. Estate planning goals: Roth IRAs can be an effective tool for <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/talk-to-your-kids-about-your-estate-plan-now-and-how-t-1850586552\" target=\"_blank\">leaving tax-free assets to heirs</a>.</p><h2>What else to keep in mind</h2><p>While a Roth conversion can offer benefits, it's not without challenges.</p><p>1. Immediate tax liability: The amount converted is treated as taxable income in the year of conversion, which could push you into a higher tax bracket now.</p><p>2. Five-year rules: Roth IRAs have several \"five-year rules\" that require funds to remain in the account for a minimum period before becoming fully tax-free. This can complicate matters for those planning to access their retirement funds soon.</p><p>3. Uncertain future tax landscape: Like I mention above, basing a significant financial decision on speculation about future government actions carries inherent risks.</p><p>For more, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/common-roth-ira-mistakes-1850935007\" target=\"_blank\">these are mistakes to avoid with your Roth IRA</a>. Given the complexities involved in Roth IRA conversions, it's advisable to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/heres-when-its-time-to-call-a-financial-advisor-1850053476\" target=\"_blank\">consult with a financial advisor</a> who specializes in retirement planning. </p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>While the potential expiration of current tax rates in 2025 has brought Roth IRA conversions into the spotlight, it's crucial to approach this decision carefully. A Roth conversion can offer significant benefits for some individuals, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. By carefully considering your unique financial circumstances and seeking expert advice, you can make an informed decision about whether a Roth IRA conversion aligns with your long-term financial goals.</p>"
